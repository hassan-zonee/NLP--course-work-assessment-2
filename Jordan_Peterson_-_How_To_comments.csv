@helmutgensen4738,"It took a whole year. For me to listen, this time, without a filter, with my heart. To ignore the name, the suit, the right-wing politics, the opinions on climate... With the Fall of America, me the full-blown cynic was back from remission. From this low elevation, however, I now see the unique opportunity to regain a sociable mood and prevent self-annihilation. You finally got me!"
@TalesOfHeilotia,"| can agree to most but the marriage, having family for young man just isn&#39;t the best thing to have.  And this is backed by data -  Case mortality rates of suicides were found to be 3.5% for both sexes, 5.2% in males and 2.7% in females. However, among the single population, either divorced or widowed, the probability of death due to suicide was 3.5 times higher (95% CI: 1.5‚Äì2.9) as compared to the unmarried. so the best thing for young man is to get financially free ( content with there finances)."

Anyway, I did the best i knew at the moment, but I gave up on so much easy pleasures for the last few weeks, got on antidepressants a few days ago and at this moment, life is so hard!!! BUT, never been more determined to fight like hell. Leaving this comment so I can come back to the video because I&#39;ve just listened to the first 30 minutes and it&#39;s very inspiring.

@NavaidSyed,"Nothing is real. It is all Maya, an illusion created by consciousness."
@NavaidSyed,"Enlightenment is not atheism. It was deistic, and atheism appropriated it. So, when you assert that the Enlightenment perspective is incorrect, you are actually claiming that atheism is mistaken. The genuinely enlightened, deistic viewpoint is entirely accurate and logical.

@Cynthia_108,"Regarding your discussion about higher education around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEP5ubPMGDU&amp;t=170"">2:50</a>, I was fortunate to have had the type of professor you described who taught me how to think. He was a philosophy teacher, and he literally said &quot;my job is to teach you how to think&quot;. Interestingly, this was at an excellent community college in California in the late 1980&#39;s. Many good teachers there back then, #1 ranked in CA at the time. AA degree in Liberal Arts gave me a great foundation and inspired me to want to learn. I hate it when people talk down about community colleges, like they&#39;re all inferior to Univerities. Some probably are, but many Universities aren&#39;t preparing students for success. I transferred to a state university for my major courses, which was also a very good program with excellent teachers whom I remember fondly. Maybe I was lucky. I am grateful to those teachers. It&#39;s a shame to see what&#39;s going on in higher education nowadays. Dr. Peterson is providing a great alternative, I wish him and his students success."
@anthonylmclay5697,Was reading mark 3 yesterday and when he mentioned blaspheming the holy spirit I recalled having just read about that in verse 28-30 but I feel like his description of the sin itself is his own interpretation. I would love for him to describe how pathological lying is the same as saying the works of the holy spirit are evil. From a philosophical/educational standpoint. I am curious.
@private2546,"I like this guy so far. This is the first time I&#39;ve heard of him. I get what he is saying and having been on the journey without his words and without god or religion being a part of it. I like doing the work for myself and not forcing it on me or others. His philosophy is kind and caring and some people may need the god part but some don&#39;t. Please don&#39;t judge. Doing good can lead to doing more good and getting  better at it. The funny thing is when a Christian assumes I am a Christian (not) gets a befuddled look on their face because I do good things, smile, love, be kind, do the right thing, etc. They try to force me to join their club and believe in their religion. True I have days when I hate, grumpy, sad but heck someone comes along and gives me a sincere smile and I&#39;m reminded  to have a good day."

@TSIRM0,"two things that I‚Äôm confident of now, tonight after watching the beginning of this podcast.

@JerzyytheCosmic1,"Wow, the atrocity commited. I agree with almost everything Dr. Peterson is saying here, but you absolutely and unequivocally do NOT have to be married. Is he nuts? &quot;Oh yeah, you absolutely have to be so superficial you MUST deal with the whims of a woman strictly so and at any moment give up half of your belongings.&quot; Laughable. The most rapid self understanding comes from being alone. It&#39;s called truly understanding metaphysics, how they turn into physics, afterwards which you can manage your existence or will in a much more self-realizing / encompassing / healthy manner."
@mr.gafolopolos7677,The amount of information and insight Dr. Peterson is able to deliver is honestly overwhelming. This is hard to listen to. In a good way
@damiens6465,Dr. Petersons relating Tate to a psychopath for having ability and confidence to attract women isn‚Äôt helping today‚Äôs completely confused men.  <br>Peterson then immediately goes on to say be dangerous which is good advice. Older interview hopefully Dr. Petersons opinion has changed. Masculinity is being attacked in the west and that take on Tate surprised me. <br><br>We‚Äôre going to pay a big price someday for leading this generation of men to go astray.

@WildAirCoach,"If you‚Äôre in Vancouver, Toronto, or anywhere in Canada, and you‚Äôre wondering why housing prices are so insanely high, you need to read Wilful Blindness. How did money laundering has completely distorted the real estate market.... by inflating prices far beyond what homes are actually worth. Because of this, so many Canadians can‚Äôt afford to buy a small crappy home or even just a small piece of land. It‚Äôs created a massive housing bubble that‚Äôs driving rents sky-high, making it impossible for people to save, buy, or move forward. And when you‚Äôre stuck in a rental market with no way to buy property or escape the cycle, it‚Äôs modern day slavery....... You work endlessly just to pay rent, with no hope of building a future.

@cxa011500,"I feel like JP talks a lot about the importance of truth, but isn&#39;t being completely honest when he evaluates religion. For example, he must know that in most religions, God is an actual diety, not the metaphorical summation of all that is good. It seems that he always goes after atheists, but gives religious fundamentalists a pass. He said there is no conflict between religion and science, but it&#39;s people who claim to be believers that cause the most conflict with science. He doesn&#39;t acknowledge at all modern-day Christian scientists who push against evolution or a universe designed without a sentient creator. He doesn&#39;t acknowledge the past of scientists being harassed or even excommunicated from the Church like Galileo BECAUSE they presented the truth. Fundamentally, religion and science must be at odds to a degree, because science can change, and the &quot;truth&quot; of God is never supposed to change.<br><br>Also, he doesn&#39;t seem to acknowledge at all that other cultures have other views, religions that make sense the them as much  sense to them as Christianity makes to most of those in the Western world. It depends on the culture you were brought up in. And he also doesn&#39;t seem to acknowledge that eventually, if society embraces religion like he seems to want, it will bring about the conflict of which religion is the &quot;right&quot; religion, and why other religions are wrong. And in the past, that conflict has brought about war and violence as much as anything else."

I started out sweeping floors in a machine shop and worked my way up to an office without a degree, and the whole time I was in the office I missed getting my hands dirty with the real artists who got the job done on the manufacturing floor. I was pushed towards higher income and status mainly by my own pride and the material desires of my ex-wife. Now a year after divorce and helping care for my ailing parents, I realized that what I actually wanted was the freedom to succeed or fail based as much as possible on merit. The blue collar trades still work that way. White collar does not. Too much politics, too much pride and arrogance. The guys on the office side of the wall often see themselves as better than someone else, especially the higher paid managers.

Your job is to figure out where you are lacking and work on that.

@marcmywords6970,"As haters will hate.. they have no comprehension of what Dr Peterson is undertaking.. this man is truly tapped into something of our higher self&#39;s and I would say he is living his personal calling.  When he speaks he fills my heart and answers so many questions with a clarity unexperienced before. I&#39;m literally trying to fill up on him as much as I can.. and as much as I can take in every day.. I will listen to him speak and he will say something that is answering something I have been searching for..  I&#39;m starting to feel and experience God&#39;s deep love and caring for me.. in a way never experienced before.. all I can say is thank you! thank you! thank you! If the haters would learn to listen, open there hearts (it takes courage to trust) they would learn true lasting change is possible.."

@Ejfranklinart,right now seems to be getting pushed way too hard and way too out of line. I had to talk to my brother who is mentally 7 years old and tell him why he probably isnt trans and its just depression and not knowing were to go because of our father dieing 8 yrs ago. And that it seems like everyone has somehow ignored getting help and finding a solution that then just directs them straight to this as a solutional because they cant learn how to accept themselves first.

@erikw113,The definition of God is the creator. God is not the essence of good he is the essence of good and evil. He did not create only good he also created evil by definition. I think on the subject of God Peterson and many others have a bias. If God created everything he would not leave out half of the equation. Humans are the only beings on earth that have the concept of good and evil. God gave us our consciousness. So imo he created both good and evil so he can not only be the essence of good.

It&#39;s my opinion that Jordan is mostly an observer with enough lived experience. There are some very wise observers.  I, sadly,  learn through experience but this is who I am for a variety of factors. I love how he condemns men with exploitive tendencies.  So grateful he has a daughter."
@cHVF,"I love Dr Peterson to bits.  I am bummed he thinks Musk/Weinstein are exceptional.  I thought it was obvious to anyone with critical thinking.  This makes me have to revisit my perception of Musk and Weinstein, both are at least fountains of misinformation and in Musk&#39;s case, fraud on such an insane level my mind spins.

When he was talking about people turning on those that are doing well kind of reminds me of how the world pushes down on those who choose simple lives. I think that a majority of humanity whose been taken advantage of is ready to see the world burn. Call it greed, wrath and envy all coming to a boiling point. Donald Trump being elected is a perfect example that we&#39;re hurling towards a much more chaotic world. I mean in reality the universe desires levels of high entropy and we&#39;re sort of that order in the chaos. Too much order and eventually people that thrive in chaos lose... hard. Causing what I believe to be war. War is just a causation of high levels of stress and disagreements. Chaos vs order. I think humanity is on it&#39;s last leg though after the 2nd World War. If we break out into another one I truly believe that humanity will cease to exist. I believe we&#39;re on a path to hell or maybe heaven. Maybe we already live in hell and death is the gateway to heaven? Either way it seems like we&#39;re on a sinking ship and the people at the top are telling everyone else it&#39;s ok."

The difference between courageous and stupid is if you don&#39;t die, good place to start, or if you come out of a situation more or less functional you get to upgrade what otherwise would have been stupid to courageous. That could be applied to a lot of what was talked about. If you don&#39;t die, consider that a win and make appropriate adjustments and then things will work out fine.

@jameshartley7644,"Rev. You are very correct this is not about you, it is about God&#39;s word and the truth of his word. Again we should be like the Bereans and search the scriptures and test what you share according to the spirit of God. <br>I am not speaking with regards to what I think I am sharing that if you are presenting as a teacher of God&#39;s word where is the biblical scripture to support your message. Again I pray that the people who come here to listen to your message search the scripture for themselves. Inviting the Holy Spirit to help them discern the word of God. Acts 17:11 Now the Bereans Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true. <br>Listen to the teacher of the Word and then go to the scriptures and compare; if the teacher and the Scripture line up then you can trust that teacher. If they do not line up then walk away. <br>We don&#39;t always want to agree with the word of God as the flesh has a will of its own. God is good all the time. He is trustworthy and safe. God love you and bless you all."
@LA67895,Im a conservative guy and why do I find Jordan Peterson annoying and not helpful
@MrWhatever1234567,First off I apologize for a previous comment I have severe attention problems since 5 years old and usually only last a few seconds at a time so it is hard to read a statement and an explanation in the same sentence. So sorry for any insensitive comment I have ever made about you or anyone else who has been offended by my opinion. My opinion. Second time it has happened to me I am a little more than a year old and I am not a qualified. Since that attack I had a long night of crazy thoughts about the Bible and what god was expecting. It was really confusing to try to understand why that happened to me. I reject their idea of chosen people and I was really scared of god because so many terrible things already happened that were devastating for me and that was the last straw I finally thought if their was a god he fiuckin hates me for sure. I can‚Äôt fathom why this mfo would do anything like that. Any way to explain why this happened to me was not able to comprehend why.  I was so confused by what happened I laid there for hours trying to mar srnce of wtf This means. So I was thinking to myself that I could not handle this much pain and then I answered my self with you have to do it to someone else. I refuse that offer and I the voice  of my self god or Saran or fish sauce say that you can not this much pain you have to do it to make it go away but I said that I would never make anyone feel like that because if I can‚Äôt handle it I will not ask someone else to take this amount of pain   I have failed many times treating people and myself badly so that I don‚Äôt pass this to someone else. It‚Äôs so terrible and no one fucken cares. You have any more questions

@ConqueringFool1,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEP5ubPMGDU&amp;t=51"">0:51</a> That&#39;s why in the coming of age intimate game and play common in western countries (or possibly a US thing, the game of &quot;Truth or Dare&quot;.. The strong majority of youth choose &quot;Dare&quot; as opposed to &quot;Truth&quot;.. That and perhaps the arrogance of youth we feel more comfortable choosing &quot;Dare&quot;.. [Pro tip, as a &quot;youthful &amp; energetic 44 year old male, looking back, 1. Choosing &quot;Dare&quot;, if you know you have the &quot;better imagination&quot;, then the &quot;arbiter&quot; of one&#39;s &quot;challenge&quot;, you know the other(s) are a &quot;grade or two below&quot; your ability and willingness. 2. Confidence can be built through one&#39;s willingness of being an &quot;open book&quot;. Be okay with who you are, your abilities and shortcomings, your sense of self, your sense of family, never be ashamed of your family, remember you didn&#39;t get to pick and choose them, but they (your parents) did &quot;choose&quot; you (think about that one for a moment). Choosing &quot;Truth&quot;, while &quot;scary&quot;, almost more anxiety inducing than choosing &quot;Dare&quot;, remember it&#39;s a game, and when played honestly among your closest of (grade-school/high-school) friends, both  being among your closest of friends and/or with perhaps a &quot;crush&quot; or &quot;love interest&quot;, you&#39;re in a &quot;safe environment&quot;, among friends. Secondly, the joking, &quot;just having fun&quot;, game play allows one to be üíØ% honest without worrying about others taking you &quot;serious&quot;.. Which reminds me of my &quot;strategic use&quot; of &quot;jus&#39; kiddin&#39;&quot; when expressing a desire or truth or &quot;planting a seed..&quot; But that&#39;s later on down the road, well after one&#39;s &quot;Irish charm&quot; as been well established and documented, and you have had some years of growing and knowing yourself and understanding love is beautiful and truly painful when lost, unappreciated, or used to deceive or manipulate. So always respect it&#39;s power and always be sincere and genuine when dealing in matters of the heart, even if and when you&#39;re &quot;jus&#39; kiddin&#39;!!...&quot; üòèüôÑü§®ü§´ü´¢ü´°üí™ü§ô‚úåÔ∏èü§ûüëçüëåüíØüíØ"

@3DMAWDoc,"I am against the use of the word rape in reference to sexual conduct with a 17 year old. <br><br>Here&#39;s why.  Rape as an act is a horrific violation of another&#39;s mind, body, and spirit. Something that will haunt the victim for life.  When you use the word to reference an act, while morally reprehensible,  is, in general, not a shock to the concise.

Haven&#39;t spoke to any of them in years . What&#39;s crazy is it&#39;s almost all by my own choice. Everybody that knows me closely,   knows I lie. There are a few, like my oldest sister that will call me out. I&#39;ll still lie lie and lie again until I think I&#39;ve convinced them. There are many people in my daily life that have no idea what I&#39;m telling a lie or that I even do tell lies. Then there are some that just let it roll over their shoulders.   What&#39;s really going to sound unbelievable is I&#39;ve just figured out over this past year that I am a pathological liar, that I do have Psychopathic, maybe sociopathic,  tendencies. Of course I&#39;ve been called a liar many times over the years. Of course I knew when I was not telling the truth. But I never considered myself a liar. Even though nine times out of 10 the first thing that comes out of my mouth is not true. I don&#39;t like it . I don&#39;t put forethought or intent into it.

That&#39;s really when I&#39;ve started seeing who I truly am and not liking it at all. I really wish that I could afford to help to find out why I do what I do and how to stop it. The best I&#39;ve come to working on my own is every time I speak a sentence to somebody, I pause I repeat the sentence in my head. I make sure that I told no fibs , I did not stretch the truth, or twist any details in any way. If I did I apologize and I correct it right there on the spot. No matter how hard I try I try to work on it I tried my very best to keep it at the Forefront of my thoughts, the truth just does not come out first every time. And I don&#39;t know what to do or how to fix it. I get so involved in it that I actually believe it. There&#39;s no doubt in my mind that I can pass the LIE detectors on many many lies I just want help. I don&#39;t want to be like this any more. I&#39;m 44, I have no kids, I&#39;m a good-looking guy, I am a hard worker, I think I&#39;m very intelligent and have always been told so.

@segoiii,"Life is simply an evil trap farm system (-&gt; loosh farm). No need to mystify or overthink anything. And it¬¥s spreading by now in the so called &quot;reincarnation soul trap theory&quot;. The rules of life are not just hard and brutal. They are simply evil. Eating and getting eaten is the basic law in nature. Then all the illnesses, the decay, deficiency everywhere. The murderer in nature is rewarded with food. Among humans the smart psychopath is the most successful type. <br>Spiritual research shows that our memories of past existences have likely been deleted before each new life (-&gt; veil of amnesia). NDEs show a clear deception system that sends souls back to earth against their will - which is why the soul trap theory has developed. The rest is just basic logic."
@dianelille4345,"I am a huge Jordan Peterson supporter, however, I disagree with his basic premise , ‚Äúoptimistic people‚Äù are naive.  I‚Äôve lived with a lot of physical suffering and through various jobs and having my family members serve in Iraq and another as a police officer and SWAT, it allows me to see and know some of the worst parts of humanity.  As an upper level executive, I‚Äôve worked with people who are the greatest people in the world, and some who are heartless.  My oldest son worked in the White House and boy, that‚Äôs an eye opener.  I can go on an on about my life‚Äôs experiences and all the horrible people, cheating, lying and other things.  No, I don‚Äôt automatically trust people anymore.  It takes a long time to earn my trust.  BUT, I remain optimistic.  I focus on all the things I‚Äôm grateful for ESPECIALLY since I‚Äôve seen the worst.  I fully understand the incredible challenges we face as  nation and as a planet BUT I remain <br>optimistic.  Even Elon Musk is optimistic and has hope.

Quoting Old Testament writings as the &quot; will of God&quot; is ridiculous, because this is the same as the New Testament writings... they are based on nationalistic preservation of the Israel structures that existed, just as the later Roman structures had to be propped up by scripture.

@germanshepherd2701,"I‚Äôve been deeply depressed for a long time. It‚Äôs a weird feeling. Maybe it‚Äôs not depression but some form of bipolarism, because I do sway from sad to happy - although sometimes I think the happiness is just distraction. In any case, the normal for me is sadness. Something that hurts just as much is the amount of time I spend stuck in ambivalence, because my mind is less clear. At least when I‚Äôm depressed and drowning in negative thoughts, self-hatred‚Ä¶ at least my mind is focused then. It‚Äôs not the sort of focus I want or like and it hurts like a migraine in my being, but when I‚Äôm stuck in ambivalence, it‚Äôs hard to think at all. I feel so much conflict and pain over both regret and unfulfilled potential that‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I feel incapacitated and my head and heart hurts. I feel weak, useless, and cursed.<br><br>Whether it‚Äôs direct and clear despair or the blurry, scratching pain of ambivalence, I can‚Äôt stop wondering‚Ä¶ why is it so hard for me to get over this myself? I want both to defeat myself, and to forgive myself, but so far I find myself unable to do either. The only thing is that I never work to destroy other people, thankfully. I have almost infinite forgiveness and understanding for the people around me, and (wishes for) happiness for them, and yet I feel like I have none for myself. And I know I need to have more of that for myself. I know I‚Äôm not a bad enough person to deserve feeling about myself how I do. I‚Äôm not a good person yet, not in the way I‚Äôd like to be, but I‚Äôm not a criminal, I don‚Äôt seek to harm others and I don‚Äôt think I do, I‚Äôve never smoked nor consumed alcohol in my life. When I see somehow who‚Äôs done worse or is in a objectively worse position than me, I‚Äôm able to automatically see positives for them. Just, not for me. And what hurts about that is it doesn‚Äôt matter how logical the arguments are for a healthy mindset, it seems my brain simply rejects them automatically in the same way it applies them automatically for those around me. What is this toxic internal hypocrisy of mine? Just knowing things doesn‚Äôt change anything. You have to put action behind the knowledge, but it‚Äôs still so hard for me to do. I don‚Äôt know why. I‚Äôm going to watch this video. Thank you Dr. Peterson.

@keithgrey,"Jordan has lost all credibility with his religious/pseudo-religious nonsense,,,,,sadly, when he speaks on testable observable psychological and cultural reality he is sharp and useful,,,,,this moronic reliance on all things supernatural is such a waste of a mind,,,,it seems like the drug addiction and his codependent‚Äôs belief in his rarity as a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù kind of drug addict has damaged his hold on reality,,,,,delusion has become foundational for him,,,,it is sad,,,,"

@islamisthetruewaytogod6812,"Hello ! May Allah protect and guide you to his light and happiness in this life and the hereafter, God bless, Ameen. Excuse me for giving a little presentation of Islam, because it is very misunderstood nowadays, especially on those ¬´ Antichrist&#39;s ¬ª times, where media and politics are mixed to distort history and truth. And terrorists (puppets of the Antichrist) who misinterpret verses, out of ignorance and political motivations, and take them out of historical context (just like radical atheists do by the way) don&#39;t help either. Thank you very much for your time.<br><br>First of all, if you have any questions regarding Islam and yourself, just open the Quran randomly, and you will find the answer in front of you, like a miracle and a sign from God.<br>	<br>Islam is an arabic word that means the Surrender to the One and Only God, our Creator, Protector, Provider, who gives us life and all that we have, we are safe and sound by his will and grace, we are His and to Him we return, and we have to thank him in this trial life by submitting to him by our free will, or later in the Day of judgment when it&#39;s too late to save our own skin. Islam was the original Religion descended to earth from heaven with Adam and Eve (peace and blessing be upon them) in the beginning of humanity. and was passed to people with the succession of the 124 000 prophets and 315 messengers of God to all nations and civilizations since, passing by Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Isma√´l, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, David, Solomon and Jesus (Peace and blessing be upon them) during the history of mankind, the last replaces and completes the previous, until the succession of the last messenger of God fourteen centuries ago, Muhammad (Peace and blessing be upon him) to complete the noble morals of all mankind, to bring humans and jinns out of darkness into light, and to purify people&#39;s religion and belief from corruption and polytheism, and return it to purity and true monotheism, like it was in the times of the prophets (Peace and blessing be upon them).<br><br>Many Religions that we know nowadays, at their beginning were true and under Islam, initiated by one of the prophets of God, but their original teachings, history and scriptures have been corrupted over time with falsification and polytheism, or lost and replaced with false ones. That&#39;s why Islam is the only Religion accepted by God nowadays, which consists in bearing witness that there is no god besides Allah (God in Aramaic, the original language of Jesus and the Gospel), and that Muhammad is His servant and messenger, just like Jesus and Moses and others are His servants and messengers. Never a messenger of God said he was God or literally son of God, it was the people after him who changed the words of God and corrupted the Religion. God is unique and absolute, He does not need to have a family and sons or to associate anyone else with His kingdom, He can simply create whatever He wants, everything belongs to Him, and to Him everything will return. Allah said in Surah Al-Mu‚Äôminun : ‚ÄúGod has never begotten a son, nor is there any god besides Him. Otherwise, each god would have taken away what it has created, and some of them would have gained supremacy over others. Glory be to God, far beyond what they describe. The Knower of the hidden and the manifest. He is exalted, far above what they associate. (91-92 / Translated by ITANI).<br><br>Allah means the one and only God, the God of all prophets and creatures, the creator of the universe and mankind, and the Master of the Day of judgment, where our destiny, Hell or Paradise, is decided based on our faith and deeds in this trial life, and above all, Allah&#39;s mercy. <br><br>Allah said in Surah Al-Ikhlas : In the name of God, the Gracious, the Merciful.<br>Say, ‚ÄúHe is God, the One. God, the Absolute. He begets not, nor was He begotten. And there is none comparable to Him.‚Äù (1-4 / Translated by ITANI).<br><br>Allah said in Surah An-Nisa : O FOLLOWERS of the Gospel! Do not overstep the bounds [of truth] in your religious beliefs, and do not say of God anything but the truth. The Christ Jesus, son of Mary, was but God&#39;s Apostle - [the fulfilment of] His promise which He had conveyed unto Mary - and a soul created by Him. Believe, then, in God and His apostles, and do not say, &quot;[God is] a trinity&quot;. Desist [from this assertion] for your own good. God is but One God; utterly remote is He, in His glory, from having a son: unto Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth; and none is as worthy of trust as God. Never did the Christ feel too proud to be God&#39;s servant, nor do the angels who are near unto Him. And those who feel too proud to serve Him and glory in their arrogance [should know that on Judgment Day] He will gather them all unto Himself: (171-172 / Translated by Muhammad Asad).<br><br>Allah the Most Merciful said in Surah Ali-Imran : Behold, the only [true] religion in the sight of God is [man&#39;s] self-surrender unto Him; and those who were vouchsafed revelation aforetime took, out of mutual jealousy, to divergent views [on this point] only after knowledge [thereof] had come unto them. But as for him who denies the truth of God&#39;s messages - behold, God is swift in reckoning!<br>Thus, [O Prophet,] if they argue with thee, say, &quot;I have surrendered my whole being unto God, and [so have] all who follow me!&quot; - and ask those who have been vouchsafed revelation aforetime, as well as all unlettered people, &quot;Have you [too] surrendered yourselves unto Him?&quot; And if they surrender themselves unto Him, they are on the right path; but if they turn away - behold, thy duty is no more than to deliver the message: for God sees all that is in [the hearts of] His creatures.<br>Verily, as for those who deny the truth of God&#39;s messages, and slay the prophets against all right, and slay people who enjoin equity - announce unto them a grievous chastisement.<br>It is they whose works shall come to nought both in this world and in the life to come; and they shall have none to succour them.<br>(19-22 / Translated by Muhammad Asad)..<br><br>God said : Say, ‚ÄúWe believe in Allah, and in what was revealed to us, and in what was revealed to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Patriarchs, and in what was given to Moses and Jesus, and in what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We do not differentiate between any of them. And to Him, we surrender.‚Äù<br>(2:136 / Translated by Community)<br><br>Salam (Peace) -----------------"
@JITINVERMA-d5w,Excellent thoughts
@cheesecakeprincess,"The information we receive can significantly influence our choices between good and evil. All existence began with His word, that double-edged sword, and it will ultimately come to an end in the same way. Our world revolves around spoken words, which manifest in actions‚Äîeither good or evil. Do we truly believe in God? Even demons believe and tremble, yet they have locked themselves out of the choice for repentance and forgiveness; they are already condemned. Simply believing in God is not enough for human redemption. It requires a self-sacrifice that many of us are often unwilling to offer in spirit before Him. True faith demands more than acknowledgment; it calls for a deep commitment to transformation and surrender. /7"
@cheesecakeprincess,"This complexity of human existence is further influenced by the interplay of the id, ego, and superego, as introduced by the father of psychology. These internal struggles, combined with the external challenges posed by society, make it increasingly difficult for individuals to coexist peacefully. Yet, the glory of God manifests through those who serve Him around the world, doing good for those in need. He is always there, opening the door for those who knock in hope for His help. Reason and logic must surrender to the biblical standards of behavior and thought, which remind us that evil thoughts arise from the human heart. /6"
@cheesecakeprincess,"The dichotomy of actions by those who claim to know God often complicates our existence and creates challenges in navigating harmony. When individuals choose not to follow biblical teachings and ignore their accountability before God, it can lead to conflicts. However, anyone who genuinely examines their heart and strives not to wrong others, in any form, has the right to feel justified because &quot;the fear belongs to the One who destroy your soul in hell and a human(s) can destroy only your physical. /5"
@cheesecakeprincess,"It‚Äôs written, &quot;We can&#39;t mock God.&quot; So, how can I reconcile being deceptive without fully recognizing it, especially when I claim to stand before God, who discerns my soul? This reflects a profound hypocrisy and deception in our hearts. Often, people expect others to bear the blame, much like the way Christ taught about turning the other cheek and not resisting evil. It raises important questions about accountability and our true intentions in our relationships with others. /4"
@cheesecakeprincess,"Often, those who cause conflict through their actions or words fail to self-examine and instead blame others for initiating the discord. In my opinion, many people may have knowledge of biblical teachings but struggle to align their behavior with those principles, often acting contrary to the very commands they are meant to follow. I find myself pondering the reasons behind this disconnect, especially when it leads to deception in the eyes of the God they claim to believe in.  /3"
@cheesecakeprincess,"I find the Bible to be a powerful source for self-reflection. However, the challenge of applying its teachings to our behavior is a struggle many of us face. Often, we don&#39;t fully consider the implications of our actions or words, assuming others will understand our intentions without realizing the impact they can have. This raises important questions about awareness‚Äîwhether individuals recognize the hurtful nature of their words or hostile actions and why they might expect no conflict in response. If we all embraced a deeper understanding of each other, perhaps we could foster a more peaceful world, truly loving our neighbors. It‚Äôs interesting to think about how awareness and empathy could transform our interactions. /2"
@cheesecakeprincess,"Is it life so difficult and challenging or some humans in power make existence difficult and challenging to others? It would be fascinating to have a chat one to one with J. Peterson. However, I&#39;ve often heard him say, &quot;Don‚Äôt think that the whole world is against you.&quot; it seems to overlook the very real experiences of individuals facing antagonism and challenges. When someone feels pressured and struggles, it can lead to thoughts that aren‚Äôt reflective of their true self but rather shaped by their circumstances. Suggesting that thinking &quot;the world is against you&quot; indicates something mentally wrong can dismiss the validity of their feelings and experiences. /1"

@LEEGULICKSON,"I am thankful that my seizures were caught, I could have killed some one and not know why. <br>I have had this condition for 54 years and not known until some one I knew caught me having an issue where I just went blank and I was staring off in to space, so I this is known as an Absence seizures, so in church I was not in the spirt, but I was in a seizure and not known it. <br>Now being adopted mom and dad were denied my medical records. <br>At 52 I was diagnosed with Autism, that was a bit of a surprise, but there is a condition, that comes with that, and that is a 30 percent chance a child will not out grow thier absence and Focal Aware or other seizures. <br><br>You see God and Jesus places people in out lives, and we are the ones that have a choice to make. <br>I called my Doctor after what the person working with our child had told me, I was slightly unsettled, and my doctor said were going to make an appointment with the neurologist for your seizures.. I said hey wait a second, I do not have seizures, but she doubled down with a very stern look, and stated under RCW or revised code of Washington state, you are not to drive once you get you car home. <br><br>So here in Washington state we have medical transportation. A service that provides should you have a dissablillity and are receiving dissablillity a way to get to your medical appointments, and it says in the word of God we&#39;re to obey the laws. <br><br>And this was one law that out of sure curisoty I looked up DUI. I I learned that if I were to go against the Doctors orders and was in a wreck, I I would be charged with DUI, but I Vehicler hommicide, and great deal of other things. As they say no excuses. <br><br>Having seizures has allowed me to access websites and support groups, so I at times I felt guilty, but I for when you learn of clonic tonic it makes absence and focal aware seizures look harmless, but then I researched what all seizures do, and they destroy you metabolic system All seizures do this because it puts your brain in short circuit mode which controls every thing, and then I took my blood sugars, and found out just how true that was considering I was pre-diabetic. <br><br>So admitting that I have seizures also means I have not control over them. It means I have to trust God and Jesus no matter what. <br><br>It does not mean that I am not afraid, I have one coming event that I hope will detect seizures, and but mine are rated at the jsut 50 to 60 percent of being caught. <br><br>So yes I take medications. And yes, I I trust God and Jesus Christ as my savior, yet it does not mean blindly being a fool and testing God. <br>I believe God can heal, yet I also believe God and Jesus says no only they have that right and I can not question, we&#39;ll I can but it would be to no avail. Just like the some others who have suffered far worse fates like losing a family, and we know the people who lost everything, and and have suffered much. <br><br>So for what ever reason God and Jesus Christ his Son, and walks with us and says I am here for you. <br>In truth my biggest fear when I go to the hospital is witnessing some one having a clonic tonic seizure. I fear because I am not sure how I would respond, but I or feel guilty for being thier, I but this disorder can kill. I could take the life of another if I drive, I could take the life of my son, but I or the ones I love, and even myself. <br><br>What you say is true, we can not make excuses. <br>For what ever reason, I can not just get in the car and drive. I have been barred from Driving. I have been placed on anti Seizure meds, I can not judge anyone for I am deffintly not perfect, I can not state that so and so has no faith or they would be heald, but I I can not state that so has a Demon when they have epilepsy. I can not judge unless God Provides the discernment, and and yes possessions are completely different than medical conditions. <br><br>God has taught me much. Perhaps one day I may save some ones life, I jsut do not know. <br><br>What I do is know, is what I am going through is not because of sin, not because of some trial, it is the path I must travel for what ever reason God has given to me. Only Jesus knows the reason. <br>For me Life is about learning new things, it is about being me being Me and trusting in God. God created me for a purpose, and I Jesus died for me. <br><br>What I can state, I is for what ever reason I must understand and Trust God for the path he has put me on. <br>Only he knows where that path will lead to. <br>I can complain whimper and whine and say woe is me, I why God... But that will be a waste of energy. Maybe this path is to teach me something I do not know. maybe it will teach me more about compassion and understanding."

@sylviedaragon2542,"No one is completely negative or completely positive, Jordan Peterson doesn‚Äôt apply his recommendations on himself. His views on men‚Äôs problems have an underlying misogynistic interpretation. He has closed views on climate change like the real Albertan that he is. He has clear difficulties with authorities.

@HodgyaiAttilaAutoVlog,I love Jordan! Every word is hitting!
@jaback7676,Thanks.
@ShaneZettelmier,"Ugh.  Jordan Peterson needs to reread the book of Job.  The part of Job that most people miss is that he did sin and he wasn‚Äôt getting any punishment. He didn‚Äôt deserve he that he obey the law well that his obedience and his works earned him salvation. God Satan was messing with Job or watching him and use that situation to bring Jobe to the realisation that he needed salvation because he was not perfect because he was a sinner and God even protected him not allowing Satan to kill him. Joe was a good man amongst humans. He was rated in the biblical aspect in the very top he was listed in the top three when God gave an example and I think it was Isaiah or Ezekiel but the whole point of the end that needed to realise that he needed Messiah because as much as he tried as good as he was, obedient he was to the law and his good work as he did. He was still a sinner and he needed salvation and messiah because he was not pure unholy and he did not deserve to go to heaven. In the beginning he‚Äôs arguing that if he could just talk to God he could tell God you got it wrong dude I‚Äôm perfect. I obey the law I‚Äôve done so many good works that I deserve to go to and you must accidentally be punishing me for something I‚Äôm not doing dude. alone is the sin of pride and obedience to lead him to salvation as so many Christians who just don‚Äôt get it still believe in the world today. In the orthodox church they‚Äôve taught for centuries this aspect that was a story for all men it was a summary of exactly that, we can‚Äôt earn salvation or never good enough. We never will be down enough. We never do enough good works that we need a Messiah. We need Jesus to save us, all of us do even the best of us, even Job."

@sebastianbache8862,"&quot;God is the spirit of moral decisions.&quot; False and a dangerous lie. We are born spiritually perfect therefore, we are the embodiment of goodness. The teaching of sin is immoral.<br><br>&quot;God is the sum of everything that is the highest good.&quot; The presumption is true if we are talking about the love we are born with, and not the one taught, said to be god&#39;s infinite love. This is a lie, and a contradiction.<br><br>&quot;We are at the counter enlightenment of mankind.&quot; Only among the dishonest who believe this is true. Which is ironic since it is them where this is in evidence.<br><br>&quot;People feel meaningless.&quot; Only the dishonest feel this way. They gave up their purpose for a promise of something better.<br><br>&quot;Big Bang model is in question.&quot; True. To the honest human being, not a problem.<br><br>&quot;The shallow pond of empathizing.&quot; Insincerity is inherent in dishonesty. So is lying and deceit. <br><br>&quot;You have to offer your children to the world, otherwise you loose them to the world.&quot; Untrue. You teach your child to understand what made the world dishonest. The belief in a lie.<br><br>&quot;Honesty is what you mean.&quot; Huh? That is not its essence. Honesty is the embodiment of integrity. Being truthful is a problem among the dishonest.<br><br>&quot;The essence of humanity is its sacrificial relationship with the world.&quot; Only if you believe in the lie of sin. <br><br>&quot;Christ is the embodiment of sacrifice.&quot; Jesus is the embodiment of honesty. Christ is the embodiment of a sinister lie in the book of sins.<br><br>Peterson asks. &quot;How can it be any other way?&quot; Meaning the sacrifice of humanity is the only option. Not true.<br><br>When you believe a truth can exist in something that can not be proven true. You become a dishonest person the rest of your life. When you believe in sin, you become your own god. This is detrimental to your existence. When you see the church manipulating innocent minds to learn to love a &quot;god?&quot; Punishment for resisting their imputation to scare, force, compel a soul to believe. Do you not see how gangster this is? A knife to the throat. <br><br>What you are not being told is the belief in sin is the only blasphemous act a human can do that has a consequence later. Nothing else matters but this. Our purpose for being here is about trust. To believe in sin breaks this trust and when you do, I don&#39;t know if this can be undone. Not by reason from our true creator, rather by the god said to come from a book, one chose to believe against the evidence from our birth. When you deny the existence of our innocence and believe it never existed, it&#39;s because you were spooked or made afraid to even question the story&#39;s veracity, first. <br><br>Unconditional love doesn&#39;t work in this way. Only someone who gave this love away believes the god of sin is the arbiter of our judgement. They are the dishonest who make this world what it is. A life divided and diminished from a lie. Follow the love you are born with, not the one they teach we must learn to love. That is a betrayal against our true Creator, who is not from a book, but remains in our soul, until you believe in the lie of sin.<br>ü©∑üß°üíõüíöüíôü©µüíúü§é‚ù§Ô∏è"

@Q5000,"I reject his idea that God is synonymous with the greatest good or good in general, at least not the Christian god. God is an arbitrary thing,  per the Bibles own definition. You are expected to love and worship God. Out of fear or reward you are expected to follow arbitrary rules. Not because they are good or a high ideal, but simply because God said so. This means faith in something for no reason. Following rules simply because you want something or out of fear of retribution is the very opposite of goodness or morality. You&#39;re not doing it out of goodness, but because you were told."

@cecilponsaing2749,"Basically there is no moral reponsibility, but because Jordan Peterson tries to make the case for it, he contorts any argument for it, and makes it so complicated.  It is simple, but he is afraid of going there; be constructive and positive,  or it goes the other way, and becomes destruction and death. There is no moral. Moral is an excuse to justify the survival mechanism,  an excuse to create artificially a survival argument in contradiction to our realization as humans that there is no purpose.  Life&#39;s good and bad or it is life and death similarly to the problem of a ship or boat in the ocean. Without forward motion, the craft is soon at the bottom of the sea, and dead.

@jamielowell4237,‚ÄúFaith‚Äù is not required and is unnecessary for those working toward a ‚Äútransformation‚Äù Faith does not require a good reason. Working hard toward a goal is the good reason for the outcome.  Peterson says a lot of reasonable things- but also stuff like this- and his voice is irritating.
@TheCarpentersApprentice,Watched without the video for a good while &amp; thought the interviewer was very self centric in his thinking. When I saw who it was I was kinda surprised. Thought this cat was more evolved.
@ariannecasiding5708,3 hours of listening to him and millions viewed this. Wow.

@TwoSeventeenEightyFour,"I&#39;ve most likely lost a very wonderful woman in my life as a result of some of these things Peterson speaks on. The worst part about it is that I know I didn&#39;t have to be the person I was, but chose to because she loved me enough to let me behave in such an ill manner. The dismissiveness of someone&#39;s love is nothing to play with. Not because it hurts when it&#39;s lost, but because of the everlasting effects it has over something so ridiculously easy to avoid."

@karinmassey7806,"In the sense of being a believer.If you find your spiritual gifts are in the forefront, it&#39;s very rewarding. I think that&#39;s what jordan peterson is trying to say in his beginnings in christianity. <br>Holy Spirit will help let go of consquences, stand alone in reality.  With Jesus realities are somewhat an ease.  Cynic attachment avoidances you don&#39;t have to stay this way.<br>Things that aren&#39;t as though they are, the bible says."
@bigh7972,I think telling other people how to live is a waste of life. Work on yourself being conscious and kind ultimately makes the world better. Until you learn to accept yourself and love unconditionally it is impossible to love another fully. Too many fathers who were abused growing up continue the cycle. Following the herd without self reflection often leads to disaster.

If he loses the thread or is found wanting on a point he will throw up some pseudo nonsensical comments which are inherently not understandable. Take heed that a undeciphered spiel does not mean that his comments are loftier or more real than yours. That said, Jordan at times makes some good diatribes.

,"I have never seen person who wants to be Christian more than Peterson but is unable to admit to himself that it&#39;s bullshit. Even if we go with the argument &quot;God is the highest good&quot;, which is very stupid in my opinion considering what people generally mean with the word, the Bible is full of shit that i would never accept as highest good even though it is presented as will of God. So Bible&#39;s God is not actually God by Peterson&#39;s definition. Bible was perhaps good guide for morality 1500+ years ago, today it&#39;s obsolete and poor image of Peterson&#39;s God for anyone.<br><br>Most people&#39;s highest good is being content personally on reasonable level and they don&#39;t pursue issues further than that. It&#39;s very subjective and self-centered. There are of course exceptions always, but you don&#39;t see normal people going out of their way to make world better place, even though they have every means to do it. If we worked that way, nobody would have ever died because of famine or lack of basic medicines. Yet people die to such things every day on this planet."

@maxkeefe8286,"JBP makes a good point about ppl arbitrarily choosing identities and how not sane that is.

But today, ppl want to announce their identities without the reality behind it.

@TheCigarCop,"God not only desires for none to parish, but also desires that ALL should come to the knowledge of the truth. There are so many verses that disprove calvinism and that would make the word in the Boble a lie, such as that he is just and loving, that shatter with the idea of predestination. Yet I only ever here elect and predestination verses with no context of whp these things are being written tp pr the verses before or after. Additionally, verses about being careful of sin and bringing other believes back from sin saving their soul from death are abundently clear about what the scripture refers to as fighting the good fight and enduring to the end, for only then is there a crown. People i speak with this about often ask me why it matters and i think it matters a ton for both believers and non believers. Because if Im new to the faith OR a non believer, and i walk into a calvinist church, the message im getting is essentially (remember that a  new believer is not ready for advanced doctrine and is consuming &quot;spiritual milk&quot;) is that &#39;well, either God picked me or he didnt. If he did, that means I can do whatever i want here and still go to heaven. And if he didnt, i might as well love sinfully and live it up here.&#39; and for the believer, that can look like justifying sin or letting things slide be ause you believe you are already secured no matter what. Its just so dangerous."

@TopgunB,"The path to happiness is wisdom. Wisdom is knowledge in the service of enlightenment. The root of all  suffering  is ignorance ( lack of wisdom). Wisdom is knowing that all suffering is due to a desire for things to he different to what they are and aversion (anger) at the reality of things as they are now. Once you remove these roots of suffering and replace them with loving kindness for all  sentient beings you will live in a state of joy and equanimity with permanent peace of mind no matter your external circumstances. This is the Kingdom of Heaven which is not over there but within as Jesus says. This is achievable and amounts to intense mind training. One path to this is intense wisdom seeking, combined with contemplation and meditation on reality. You will find that only love is real and permanent all other things are impermanent. If you obtain deep and direct knowledge of this you will be enlightened which results in permanent joy and peace of mind which is what we all seek whether we know it or not."

@queeni9ja,"I really liked this interview because it‚Äôs a believer speaking with a non believer and shows how the emptiness of a non believer can cause many issues in their life and how they view life and it‚Äôs ups and downs, while relying only on themselves, their abilities and tangible things, but at the end of the day, they lack true internal joy or contentment. As opposed to a believer who uses the word (Holy Bible) to judge and contextualize life and the struggles/experiences/joys in life are endured/experienced using a higher power outside of self, which allows the believer to deal better with life‚Äôs ups and downs, can guide their life, can bring true joy in the experience on the way to the goal, can find happiness in serving others, and turns their vision/thoughts/focus away from self. So when life‚Äôs down times happen, a believer is able to have internal peace despite what is going on, and therefore tend to bounce back stronger and their recovery ends up being a glorious testimony that helps others. A non believer has a harder time dealing with life‚Äôs downs, and the sum total of their negative experiences in life are more likely to make them nihilistic, depressed, anxious, suicidal, bitter, and just generally negative. These overall negative feelings affect the physical body, and their negative thinking begets negative feelings."

@buycryoto7098,Absolutely indecision is a terrible state to be in. I‚Äôve learned to make the same decision everyday and it‚Äôs improved my quality of life
@buycryoto7098,What if your goals are to build something that really benefits people but you have too much on your plate to have a committed relationship and the only way to accomplish what you want to do you have to stay single? Do psychos and narcissists have goals that benefit other people? And deal with the pain of staying single. I‚Äôve been motivated from Peterson talking about pain being a part of life. Obviously he‚Äôs way smarter than me and what he said about relationships is prolly valid but to label people that don‚Äôt want a long term relationship as psychos and narcissist is too black and white for me. But gotta say I love Peterson
@buycryoto7098,It‚Äôs pretty rare I disagree with Peterson but I‚Äôm happy not being in a relationship. I do commit to my family but I don‚Äôt like having a spouse. It‚Äôs basically extra work when I‚Äôm having a hard enough time just going to work to provide for myself. 100% agree that when you think about yourself it leads to anxiety from experience. It can be positive but eventually it leads to anxiety for whatever reason and negativity. Meditation puts a better view on all thoughts tho

@robertrettig7110,"üòÆJordan, there are tens of thousands of us who are anxiously waiting for you to quit performing the one unforgivable sin, which is blaspheming the Holy Spirit! That sin is the rejection of Jesus as our redeemer, and that He is the only way to Father God! We have to come to the end of ourselves, understand our wretchedness, and ask Jesus to forgive us. This is called being born again! How is the Truth at odds with anything in this conversation? Many of us see you right on the edge of acceptance of Jesus, but your ‚Äúscientific viewpoints‚Äù of your field are holding you back‚Ä¶.The Bible talks about ‚Äúpride goes before a fall‚Äù. You‚Äôre so busy analyzing everyone and everything, you forget that your followers are analyzing you too! I don‚Äôt know if you study prophecy (30% of the Bible) or not, but it‚Äôs clear God is wrapping things up with events and insanity the Bible talks (read Matthew 24 for just a taste, and Ezekiel 37-39, and ask yourself if any of this CURRENT world situations fit) about! God says in the Bible prophecy is given so we know He‚Äôs God! We‚Äôre soon to be raptured, imagine yourself waking up finding yourself left behind? God has been calling and calling you and He wants you to wake up! He‚Äôs not willing for anyone not to be with Him, so He gives us Tribulations to begin the humbling we all need to quit relying on ourselves and surrender to Him! Ask yourself IF all the things that‚Äôs happened to you with your credentials are a coincidence or not! God‚Äôs peeling you away from the things that are consuming you and keeping you from being all in. I‚Äôm a retired Naval Officer, Nurse, played and managed bands, done a lot of community volunteer work, etc; staying consumed to the max. God woke me up by taking away the physical ability to do these things and I reached that moment you guys are talking about. Only, I knew to reach out to be born again! My life is richer, anxiety is gone for the most part, awaiting the return of my Lord! I, like Paul said, am trying to occupy till He comes. I used to get sad thinking my country and everything I worked for, and identify with was gone! Now I understand why living for this world without God, makes everyone so dysfunctional !

Religion not a part of the basic educational system- it is limiting to the the thought process and gives the educators chance at bias. You can practice outside the class room.. with exception of philolsophically based classes that are not weighted or biased in an specific way.   History taught as honestly as it can be relayed.. and not just the history related to our relatively recent and local world.. It&#39; important to see that the basic history of mankind  tends to repeat and has for man regardless of era, gography and culture. The arts to be taught alongside with a serious tone to be taken serioulsy- as the arts tend to reflect the world around them and tell truth even when the mouths of politicians and preachers do not. <br>Sex addressed seriously as a matter of biology and not made out to be taboo creating an unhealthy attitude that only leads to it being exploited in some way as control mechanism..<br>And the most important things that are absent almost completely are basic macro and micro economics like the fractonal reserve banking to balancing and reconciling an account - and civics- not patriotism.. but the basic workings of the processes that lead to how statutes come into existance and what role of the documents on which those things are founded play .. patriotism needs to inspired through this.. not drilled into ones head as a mandate to build cannon fodder when it&#39;s summoned.

Under this explanation, there is no constant good or bad, and if setting God as source of good, it means it is something totally personal source of interests. Belief in absolute good, means what you classify now , here as acceptable  and or desired, will be bad later / elsewhere for you, and your god turned evil  to you :) . Now think what eternity to a god means being good for you? Static existence , worse than stone, or water, as these also change in eternity. Remember when you bought your last pair of shoes ... how Good they were. Please try to say exactly the same for the pair of shoes a year later. Did they turn evil to you ? :)"

@raphaellavictoria01,"I listened now to a good 5-7 minutes of this, as a sample of his thoughts. Certainly some things are very true, but other things, e.g. the whole diatribe about the granddaughter, are unnecessary elaborations while being simplistic, all at the same time: such as, boundaries aren&#39;t there to help your child be the best of themselves, but they&#39;re important because 1. you&#39;re a person too, 2. the child needs to learn there is such a thing as boundaries, and respect them. I wouldn&#39;t just tell them, &quot;don&#39;t do that&quot;. Get in the habit of asking, why did you do this? And then you tell them how it made you feel, or what it would look like to someone else, such that they understand why it&#39;s wrong. <br><br>Seeing the &quot;hidden soul&quot;: VERY true. But the whole Michelangelo &quot;see the David in the block of marble&quot;, smacks of narcissism to me. WHO the fuck are you to presume to see what I could be? He&#39;s not only talking about kids, here. They&#39;re talking about romantic partners! People aren&#39;t a block of marble, they&#39;re already a statue. Bad analogy at best. Yes, when they&#39;re young, the marble hasn&#39;t hardened yet, and the shape has yet to grow. But with an adult, the best you could do is ask, are you a David? I kind of see a David in you, am I wrong? Don&#39;t you ever think you can shape them into a David, or &quot;encourage&quot; a David in them, unless they already have a chisel in their hand.<br><br>I don&#39;t like what Peterson says about going through a thousand fights and then having peace, sounds like a poor match to me, nothing more. Also, if someone annoys you, what&#39;s with the wait until the third time rule? Why wait, and why the third time, exactly? Something about Jordan Peterson is not good. A lot of what he says is insightful, glad to hear someone say it. But not everything. I guess there&#39;s a reason he&#39;s doing cocaine, and I would never touch drugs."
@jayramirez5379,"Outside the celebrity comparison, the answer is simple, I‚Äôm talking of getting married not just dating. The reason why a man in its late 30‚Äôs or even 40 wants to marry a woman in her 20‚Äôs is because women are more attractive at that age (exclude exceptions). And if both want to start a family it‚Äôs easier for a woman in her 20‚Äôs to become a mother. Men are more responsible when they are older, and women like men who are responsible. This not a red pill B.S."

It&#39;s not even the religious part that i find it tedious but the way he overthinks everything and turns and twists meanings just to be the deep thinker... that is not for me... I&#39;ve been listening to Jordan since 2017 and the best things I&#39;ve found him doing are the Maps of Meaning series from University and some earlier podcasts when he was defending his freedom of speech. Lately, while I do try to listen to what he&#39;s saying, at some point (I&#39;ve stopped the video @ 1.55 minutes mark) he just makes it impossible for me to continue listening. Not even sure why I bother to write this as I don&#39;t usually tend to comment on youtube anymore but maybe, some constructive criticism that someone will bring up to him at some point."

I noticed he wasn&#39;t well,  he shoved sad, and lovely,  and he was ill, and grossly overweight he said,  and that he had arthritis all over.  He&#39;s not married and doesn&#39;t have any children.  I truly believe he was SA as a child, and the whole thing broke my heart. I didn&#39;t want him to know i was sending all these,  and i made it a point to be there for him.  Iv text and call him often,  and now i can see that he&#39;s reaching out to me.  I told him that men who are married live longer,  because they nag their husbands into going to the fiftieth,  to eat healthier,  and to exercise. So i made him laugh b6 saying i well be acting like his wife, and nag him.  I&#39;m a fascinated by nutrition, and natural healing.  So, I have recommended he stated the carnivores diet with me.  I sent him a few videos, told him about the Petersons story, and how many people were seriously healed, cured, lost weight,  and build musscles, etc.  Iv think i hot to him at the right moment,  because we spoke about this before,  and nothing he wouldn&#39;t.   Most importantly though,  I&#39;m encouraging, honest, loving and i day things to him that I&#39;m pretty sure he doesn&#39;t hear anymore,  &quot;I love you,&quot;  and I&#39;m reminding him of his worth, and how precious he is,  and I&#39;m genuine.  It&#39;s been a short time and I know he&#39;s beginning to change.  I&#39;m absolutely  loving our relationship. He now is teaching out and helping me with things he&#39;s good too.

I cannot remember everything that George said, but I was shocked at his attitude and his words. I was content with my life at the time, I liked driving a truck for my brother and I did ask my brother if he would sell the truck that I drove to me and he declined to do so, which was a bit of a disappointment but nothing that was very important to me. I was very happy to drive a truck and I enjoyed what I did. I was hardly a professional driver according to some people, but I just enjoyed working on the equipment and the experience of being on the road. Birdbrain is who I was known as.

I love these discussions, but they almost make me more frustrated because I think they could help, if I only knew what my goal/direction was."

The way he seems to talk is more to hypnotize people than actually present real meaningful statements. It‚Äôs not my style, maybe because I am done with people making things up and surrounding it in a bunch of mind control tactics to inject an ideology that you may not even want or agree with.   This guy just strikes me as a dishonest ass.  But I must say reading the comments here kinda changed me a bit about him.  I suppose he may not be as bad as my picture of him is."

@mattavila9683,My only question is what about a person so disabled like myself that I refuse to bring another person into my life because I know that any relationship I would try ends up turning into my caretaker and then turns into more of a professional problem then a true relationship. I&#39;m 38 male virgin. I&#39;ve had 8 back surgeries starting with posterior and anterior back surgery at Shriners hospital fusing t3 to t5 and then my last surgery was an emergency surgery because my s1 l5 had exploded onto my sciatic nerve and ligaments and then the last surgery after that was another emergency surgery because when they fused the s1 l5 to the other fused vertebrae they left a screw loose and one screw too tight so if I looked for a relationship anywhere I know how much baggage I&#39;m bringing to the table and not only do I not want to give this baggage to anyone but I don&#39;t even think I could take any more baggage from any other person I have never met anybody that has as many problems as I do stuck in a place with the health care system that is not helping me with pain not helping me with quality of life and it&#39;s tiring I look forward to death because if I look forward to death at least I&#39;m not looking forward to another back surgery in which I pretty much am always afraid of because every time they open my back they are destabilizing my spine but anyways my identity is the person I was when I was 13 I had became a professional drummer was in a band called endeavor we made a song for John Hardy for the WWE and then I was forced at the age of 14 to become a pharmacy technician and on my own I became a computer technician for Dell but I never worked a day in my life because of my shorman&#39;s kyphosis disease and for sure I can never work now because my first back surgery gave me such severe nerve damage which the doctors called over correction life sucks you can&#39;t think you&#39;re way out of this one

@royhillis3317,"I disagree with some things Peterson says, like I do with virtually everyone. But what I think people miss about him is that he is teaching us how to think, not what to think. So even when I disagree with his conclusion, I learn how he arrived at it, as he paints it with words. So I get a lovely window into the mind of someone who thinks slightly different...and I learn something. <br>How to think is more important than what to think. As you need to know how to think in order to think of anything new. Otherwise, you&#39;re just an echo of someone else.<br>So I like him, a lot."

@onlygodknowswhat7595,"Women think they are emotionally literate, however the master of emotion digests it alone.<br> This has been the unspoken inside joke for centuries.<br> Women want us to talk about what is bothering us, all this does is stir up the feelings we are already processing naturally.<br> Causing us to relive them and have to start the process all over again.<br> We are not children that need to be coddled.<br> A good man learns to keep things to himself.<br> Women feel better about themselves when they ask a man what is bothering him,so he is forced to come up with a reason other than the one that she created that is actually bothering him because he knows if she knew  she was doing something that was upsetting she would simply act hurt and attack him, but 99% of the time the truth would crush her self confidence.<br> So he chooses and is forced to hold his tongue.<br> These are the things men do for women that they will never understand.<br> If you found a man that is truly open to talk about his feelings, like without a filter open book style.<br> Your going to think he is terrible.<br> I watch other men dealing with tantrums women throw, and every man that sees this knows what is really going on, but out of respect we dont even talk about it.<br> Women crave men that lead, yet society has undermined the methods of leading as macho or chauvinistic.<br> How is a man supposed to be a man if being a man is hated?<br> Women listen to the nonsense and look for a man that fits the ideal other women tell them they need.<br> When they should listen to their own idea of what man they are looking for.<br> These are the main causes of divorce in America, people listening to other peoples ideals and finding the wrong person for them as a result."

@paulsaulpaul,Jordan said that Helen Lewis was very smart when she was interviewing him and trying to ruin his reputation.  I paused this video right then and went and watched the entire one hour and 45 minute interview with her.  He gives her way too much credit.  She is an intellectual child with a one-track mind.  I applaud Jordan for being level headed enough to maintain his composure in the face of such stupidity.

@gardenjoy5223,"Concerning writing what the professors want to read. I didn&#39;t. Got just sufficient grade to pass on a piece that was outstanding, but challenging the professors own view. He started to ignore me in class! Wouldn&#39;t answer my questions either. Until one day I sought him out and confronted him with that. He said he wasn&#39;t aware of it, but would do better. He actually did. After about a year I was acknowledged as one of the forerunners of the whole program. At the end professors shared with each other what I had written on a subject. I graduated with the highest possible grade for my thesis (flawless), the second one in 25 years. If only employers had had that integrity! To be highly gifted is a cursed blessing, or a blessed curse. Not sure yet."
@gardenjoy5223,"The journalists as described are found in all professions, everywhere. Many people nowadays don&#39;t get the first thing right in life. You want to look for a situation, where both people feel better for the contact. Not one worse. A win-win situation is the higher moral ground. A win-lose situation, where one takes pride in destroying another person and/or his/her reputation, is detrimental to both, for slander is such a dangerous sin, that it alone is worthy of being thrown in hell for. In fact, it is character murder. Having been on the receiving end of it in a country full of malevolent people, makes one see how such a country will never become better. For they try to murder the best with words. As such, they produce and protect their own downfall."

@ssgg23,"I appreciate his psychology knowledge, but his chosen research emphasis on religious narrative in relation to neuroscience doesn‚Äôt often come across well in interviews. He jumps too much between random bible stories and other religious aphorisms and relates them back to his generalized psychology background, which he really doesn‚Äôt need to do to get his point across. This issue with his presentational style is really apparent in the ‚ÄúHow to know if you should end a relationship‚Äù section. He‚Äôs giving the same advice as any other PHD on YouTube but is throwing in stories about Adam and Eve to make it sound more profound and mystical. It gets a bit ridiculous at times."

Trying to &quot;change the world of EXPERIENCE, from within the EXPERIENCE itself.&quot;    (trying to change the image in the mirror, instead of changing what is making the image) So the analysis of Peterson although mostly correct, needs to go one or two levels down toward the very root of the &quot;tree of life.&quot;   The clear understanding of what it is to be human, the reality of WHO and WHAT we are thing.<br><br>Jung has many references to the &quot;Unconscious&quot;, the &quot;Subconscious&quot; etc. and the concept of Ego, which is nothing more than a &quot;imaginary self&quot; that is a matrix of thoughts, beliefs, and intentions that has been conditioned since childhood.   Viktor Frankl wrote a book named &quot;The Unconscious God&quot;, also trying to describe the nature of the &quot;unconscious&quot;.<br><br>In religious writings this same concept is put forward, and is included in the Bible, and in the teachings of Jesus.  The I AM, THAT I AM concept, the &quot;STILL SMALL VOICE&quot; concept, the I AND THE FATHER ARE ONE concept etc.   That everything we EXPERIENCE emerges from a PART OF US that we are not CONSCIOUSLY AWARE OF.  And if we want to change what emerges into the &quot;world of appearances&quot; we need to be &quot;CONSCIOUS&quot; of what THAT is, what our TRUE NATURE IS, &quot;created in the image and likeness of God&quot;.  That we have all the &quot;attributes&quot; INTERNALLY, that we ascribe to an EXTERNAL God.<br><br>To get any inkling of the mechanism by which this works we need to examine closely WHAT DREAMS ARE.  If you remember the content of any of your dreams, and ask the question &quot;WHERE DID THAT COME FROM&quot;, from where does the content of your dreams emerge???  There is a sense of &quot;time&quot; and &quot;space&quot;, and an &quot;apparent material environment&quot;, and some &quot;apparent situation&quot; in which you appear to be.  But ALL THAT CAME FROM WITHIN YOURSELF, where else could it come from???  So you are both the &quot;CREATOR OF&quot;, and the &quot;EXPERIENCER OF&quot; your dreams.  AND you now have all these NDE experiencers testifying on YouTube about their NDE experience, without recognizing that the whole NDE experience CAME FROM WITHIN THEIR OWN SELVES.<br><br>AND THAT IS ALWAYS THE REALITY IN ANY CONSCIOUSNESS STATE, &quot;You create your own reality, by your thoughts, beliefs and intentions&quot;  IT ALL COMES FROM THE GOD WITHIN, AND NOT FROM ANYTHING WITHOUT. <br><br> &quot;Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, &#39;Move from here to there,&#39; and it will move.

But she spent some time in thought about what I‚Äôd said and couldn‚Äôt find any holes it and realized this is not who she wants to be."

@FoodTruckEmily,"I found Peterson in my wilderness while I was trying to reckon with my aching for God, whom I had turned away from 15 years prior. He turned over the soil of my heart that ultimately led to me returning to God‚Äîhowever, he has become fixated on things that undermine his message. His comments on war/arabs/jews has been a redline for me. So irresponsible. I am grateful for what I got from him, but really sore that he lost the Arab community."
@haskeww8193,Dr Peterson is a brilliant man and physician. He has helped restore my faith in doctors. I am LGBT and I am not offended at all by some of his other content our people have to be protected from a medical industrial complex that wants to profit from their confusion and trauma. He is excellence and I would love to have some sessions with him despite having learned to be my own physician. Brilliant he truly is! Such courage and tenacity!
@TahneeRifaiy,"BUT‚ö†Ô∏è A lot of the Business Managers are Psychiatric in order to endure the career setting. Many will have families to balance it or recover from financial pressures, then once children reach college age, there will be another phase to recover from. In cases of childhood traumas, there may be creatives who will carry their stories intensity around until a later phase when processing it becomes a matter of life or death. At this point, maybe reaching the survival of psychiatry when the acting becomes deadly &amp; no longer possible. Such a voice may be muted or not meant to exploit on line &amp; the preservation of it, becomes the artworks of Great Painters, who could tell the story without voice &amp; words, where spoken/written crafted works excessively often out of psychiatric careers/families. <br>Then the Painter is faced with hardship, not able to make 9-5 commitments of time &amp; exposure to society due to over-exposure layered within deep early trauma. Not everything is easy access, such as wi-fi  instant click eye/ear candy. A Painting is created to call everyone into the local communities for a kind of spirit exchange that cannot happen on line.  Dr. Peterson has an experience that paints such a picture worthy of gathering in for contemplation on The Culture War. The Painters survival is held by Great Dr‚Äôs &amp; Spiritual Leaders.

So if you project falsehoods they will become part of you. <br><br>He and Chris also concur that this behavioral parameter works in a positive light as well.  For example, if one behaves as if they&#39;ve attained something they haven&#39;t yet, they WILL attain it. SO, If a person acts as if they&#39;ve accomplished something THEY&#39;LL EVENTUALLY BE ACCOMPLISHED?<br><br>This is a widely accepted notion in esoteric circles. There is definitely something to the addage &quot;Attitude is Everything.&quot;. . .<br><br>. . .But then Chris adds something about:<br><br> &quot;FAKE IT TO MAKE IT.&quot; <br><br>I am continually put off by this statement. Why? Because we now live in a society INFESTED with &quot;Fake it to Make it&quot; people. These are people PRETENDING  TO BE COMPETENT in positions of responsibility. We work in proximity of these wannabes AND THEY SCREW UP CONSTANTLY and are still compensated well for it.<br><br>Those of us that do know what the hell we are doing wind up picking up the messes these nincompoops leave behind.

@slipkik8781,"the question at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEP5ubPMGDU&amp;t=11100"">3:05:00</a> was really impressive from chris, and jordan&#39;s answer &quot;worshipping intellect&quot; summarized some of my relationship with his work. When i first discovered peterson a lot of things in my life started improving, and yet despite that fact i was able to find a bunch of different reasons to stop listening to his voice that were all pretty much predicated on my instinct to worship my intellect, and also pride since i didn&#39;t want him doing all my thinking for me even though i kind of needed someone to tell me what to do back then.<br><br> if anyone else listens to peterson and struggles with the identity crisis that can come from having a single person you dont know hashing out a lot of your spiritual work for you, i&#39;d say imagine when a doctor prescribes you medication, and also supplementary medication to counteract the side effect from the initial medication: you should listen to peterson, but not if you aren&#39;t doing your own reading on the side, like classical novels (they are a good bet since everyone can agree they are great, and can come to a consensus on their thematic content, but the experience of reading them and the ultimate takeaway can go towards the process of individualization since everyone has their unique connection to these novels). <br><br>I think also, that pretty much all of the words and the delivery that jordan uses when talking about matters of self improvement are all great, but when it comes to the territories where he for example talks about situations in which people should have some righteous anger, you again need a supplement to digest all of that without getting lost in it, and i&#39;d suggest transcendental meditation. I&#39;m not a particularly hateful person but years ago I weaned myself off of peterson because i was confused about the application of my righteous anger since i didn&#39;t have the experience of meditation informing my intuition, which would have rounded out everything that i learned from listening to him that bit better. <br><br>if anyone&#39;s confused about that last paragraph i basically just mean that whenever he would describe a situation that i felt i had found myself in, or whenever he described something going wrong in society that i thought i could observe instantly in my own surroundings, i was afraid that the validation of hearing it wasn&#39;t really going to be great since i&#39;m already assertive enough to understand when someone or something is doing me wrong, that adding even more fuel to the fire would be overkill and make me an actual shit resentful self centered person, and that hearing that stuff over and over was sort of like a circle jerk and nothing more for me. Transcendental meditation connects you to the ideal that jordan preaches so far as i understand it, as he for example says shit like you shouldn&#39;t ever hate anyone, not even your enemies, and i think that without the experience of TM you only begrudgingly follow such advice and don&#39;t really own it or understand it  under purely utilitarian conditions (and doing so, so far as i can imagine, is not the highest ideal of which jordan speaks of)<br><br>theres an instinct to stop listening to peterson for much the same reason that there is an instinct to stop learning things about the world, you become cynical and vaguely know you took the right step, but that it spiritually degraded you somehow, and its not until you can bridge the gap again through some deeper wisdom that you can integrate the true redeeming essence of the stuff jordan&#39;s on about when he talks about that highest ideal."

My second hypothesis is that you and Alex Hormozi are both examples of what ordered autism without dysfunctional looks like. You guys are both exceptionally intelligent and masters in your fields. I believe the ASD community would benefit greatly from you two helping us to understand how to be functional. The intellectual challenges you have faced will tell the whole story"

@hikermike4661,"There are some things to remember... Women (overwhelmingly) love differently than men.  That means they are attracted to money, lifestyle, and utility.  The chads win.  However, in time, the chads go for different or younger women as chads discards begin looking for resources elsewhere.  This is where average guys need to be careful.  Interest in you is really interest in her desire to extract resources from you while waiting for the next Chad.  If you fall for this trap then the women have an entire court system designed to assist them in extracting resources from you.  50% of  marriages end in divorce, and 80% of the time she filed.  100% of the time she walks with cash and prizes, and likely some form of backdoor alimony.  If your little woman has been married before than everything stays the same except the odds are now 75% chance of divorce.  Third time it jumps up to 85%.<br><br>The best thing to do when the game is rigged is not to play. Get the cords cut because getting a woman pregnant is like adopting a child.  You are now on the hook to support her for 18:years -- backdoor alimony.  If you get a raise she gets a raise.  Your children are considered hers by the court and all the bills, including hers, are yours.  You have to be thinking self-preservation from long before she enters your life because she will never love you, she only loves what she thinks she can aquire from you: money, lifestyle, utility.  That&#39;s all you are to her, the government, and the women&#39;s court system."
@kathyfann,"What a genuine help Dr. Peterson is he brings things down to a point that just almost everyone can grasp and begin the road to improvement, small steps as he says at a time but take courage and begin is what he‚Äôs teaching us and it‚Äôs absolutely correct. Thank you, Dr. Peterson."

@bane349,"Kind of interesting to hear this reknowned sage say sometging so absurd as the rise of nihilism being the begining of wisdom when it is in fact the exact opposite, go read what other great philosophers thought of nihilism for yourself, it wasnt good at all.  The reason we see a rise in nihilism and absurdism is due to the algorithms promoting it to us in order to dumb people down so that they dont see the satanism all around us and bit by bit generation by generation they accept more and more of it."
@timchalmers1700,"The Matthew principal at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEP5ubPMGDU&amp;t=1140"">19:00</a>: Matthew 25:29 &quot;For to everyone who has shall more be given, and he shall have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away.&quot; This is a puzzling statement and needs to be understood from the context. Jesus often taught in parables. This verse comes at the end of a parable so it is necessary to look at the context to understand the meaning. This verse applies to the third servant who did nothing with what the Master provided. In this parable the Master allegorically represents God. The &quot;money&quot; that God provides to the servants, namely us, is new life or salvation through Jesus Christ. The first two servants took what God provided them and produced more. The third servant did nothing with what God provided and was cast into outer darkness."

Bit of a Christ complex, archetype at work in Mr Peterson‚Ä¶  We humans cannot escape archetypes coming alive in our psyche, and Jordan has sense enough to go along with that tremendous force, as it is for good. And as it transcends time Jordan has am i tuition about the future, perhaps even a vision on where it is all headed. And as nowadays there are cultural forces, woke ideology some call it, that drive many people, whole  countries towards great levels of being not happy,  Jordan seeks to oppose these forces.   That way he kind of saves more people hen he could as a therapist. He should focus more kn mass communicating his insights and messages, not use his limited energy on therapy also. <br><br>Therapy was a learning school, that is over now, Jordan!"
@irfangullbhat,"My opinion is in these times we (muslims as well) should cherish, celebrate and take maximum benefit from DR JORDAN B PETERSON...the man is crammed with wisdom..not confined to pleasure taking effect only but the wisdom that actually works &amp; can with enough impact help to navigate with the ever stressful, unfamiliar, rapidly changing modern world and it&#39;s twisted and perverted ultra-modern dwellers that have the ability to bring even the best of liberals into astonishment with their sick stances. These WOKE people are in fashion and it&#39;s unfortunately a fashion to have an opinion on every social, political and whatever issue and try and get as sicker as possible with their stances  &amp; agendas. <br>Me starting from a traditional, fundamentalist islamic sort of, maududi cheerer, a die hard Dr israr fan saw my journey from one extreme of calling everything sin to the other of modern, agnostic, hedonistic, atheistic, a fastly growing WOKE &amp; finally a suffering nihilistic where I called everything pointless. I was into people like sam harris (still like him though on other issues), dillahunty, Richard Dawkins, Hitchens and betrand Russel.  When I say pointless, I went for almost half a decade without bothering to brush my teeth, just to name one. So I have had a first hand experience living with both extremes.<br><br>Long story short, with time  I could experience Allah teaching me how important it is to be spiritual, praying regularly, work being worship,  being tolerant, loving people of all religions, somewhat sufism,  helping poor, not being haughty &amp; self-centred, avoiding womanizing, not being overtly paternalistic, but also not going out of the way in support of women &amp; keeping it fair,  staying away from stimulants, nicotine &amp; substances, meditating, remembering Allah, not running after money, taking wisdom from all good people from whichever backgrounds. <br><br>When I decided to follow these principles, i revisited Jordan B peterson, oh boy, he was telling this all along, only difference is earlier I would listen to him more for leisure and viewed him more as a psychologist but   I can tell you this guy is so so right. Over the years some of his gems I can recall are:<br><br>Start by correcting what&#39;s next to you<br><br>The simple things that you do daily make 50  percent of your day so they are the most important things in life<br><br> It won&#39;t hurt to brush your teeth<br><br> when belief system collapsed in the modern world not only did the belief system collapsed but the belief in belief systems collapsed as well (so true)<br><br>The above void in spirituality was filled by and gave rise to ultra nationalism that followed in Europe (now in our part as well). Scintillating observation. Tells us how important religion is, especially spiritually &amp; ritually as well to keep you in satisfying action.<br><br>Pick your sacrifice. You don&#39;t get to choose it as it&#39;s going to occur to you anyway so pick one before it gets to you<br><br>Peterpan stuff was ü§£ &amp; embarassing at the same time<br><br>His views on how non- religiousity can lead to nihilism. Being nihilist can feel worse than depression and anxiety. Once you see everything as pointless, it&#39;s hell. <br>West is getting filled with it pretty rapidly especially new generation. This again signified how important religiousity and spirituality is. Unfortunately it will eventually affect us as well like everything comes from West and settles in east. Nietzsche was so right.<br><br>I really like how he sticks and tries his best to take beneficial and meaningful takeaways from the Bible. Authenticity doesn&#39;t matter to him, if the thing is good and helping him accept it. This is a monumental effort, sitting in west, being famous, and doing all this in the face of tornado of criticism and denunciation of biblical literature &amp; mockery modern Christians make of biblical stories <br><br>His condemnation for wokism is really attractive for we muslims.<br><br>I loved him when he famously said I act as if God exists. I could understand this statement. He was catering to the mindset of atheistic / agnostic, anti religion and liberal forces, and at the same time articulately teaching them how arrogant &amp; silly they  sound when they  explicitly keep stating &quot;God doesn&#39;t exist&quot; without much clue to back it up and here is a man who knows how his belief in God has helped him all his journey yet he stays away from saying explicitly &quot; God exists&quot; or not even says &quot; i believe in God&quot; so as to not sound arrogant and distinguishing between people. <br><br>WHY I AM POSTING THIS<br><br>It&#39;s about a lot of Muslim brothers and sisters who have to their peril and unfortunately turned away from him after him showing his right-wing tendencies in his political views, particularly on Israel, &amp; sometimes on Islam. I personally overlook his recent views, particularly at the age he is now, and am ready to forgive him for these utterances. These come &amp; are mostly attributed to his commitments with DW and alliance with people like Ben Shapiro, which could have been helped &amp; developed from sharing traditional values. Anyways at this age one can be more vulnerable to get swayed by agenda driven people who want to use him for their benefit. <br><br>We can and should continue to benefit from his wisdom as a clinical psychologist, traditionalist, socialist, spritual, philosopher, anti-left and anti woke and a person who actually cares for a lot of evil that prevails in this world right now. As a package he is wonderful and awesome with some opinions that we won&#39;t like of course. But we can&#39;t afford to discard him altogether and play in the hands of those people who couldnt stand his huge muslim following and want him completely in their camp."
@NJTremblay-dp4gr,"am i in this point.. i am real to myself.. but my life is going as much as i make it forward.. but how is it that alot of us use God or Jesus to make a certain decisions.. which i have fallacy with as have lived a solid life, good to ppl and have no regrets.. so how has religion, god and jesus has blinded us to being a human being not a fateful human..  i have no delusion that most of the world has a God.. but do we see the happy world.. but i understand turmoil, bereavement and needing a light at the end of the tunnel.. but how is that some humans can be real... but fake God.."
@ryanfisher5376,"&quot;The heaviest things in life aren&#39;t iron and gold, but bad decisions. The reason you are stressed is because you have decisions to make and aren&#39;t making them&quot; ... I&#39;m an engineer who gets very attached to the projects I take up. My boss gave me the best bit of advice and that was to look at the Serenity Prayer. We need the wisdom to realise what is in our control and what is out of our control. There&#39;s no point in stressing about things that are out of your control. A decision to do rework on a part in order to make deadlines when you&#39;re up against the wall is needed but is also out of my control. The part was always going to come in late and wrong. I therefore disagree with that statement; stress is self administered when we try to take control of things we have no control over."

@gailhill8391,"God just told the truth. Job&#39;s fear put the crack in the hedge that God had around Job (Job 3:25). Job didn&#39;t have fear for his own life (as in dying) as much as he had it for or about his kids and the other things in his life. Job 1:5 &quot;And it was so, when the days of [their] feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings [according] to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job CONTINUALLY.&quot; This hints at Job&#39;s fear. God ALWAYS tells us to &quot;fear NOT.&quot; Perhaps Job should have done something with his sons such that Job wouldn&#39;t have CONTINUALLY had this fear. Or maybe this is actually the story of legalism, and how SELF righteousness because of sin consciousness, just can never give abundant life the way Jesus Christ brought it to us by grace. The devil is just a creep and likes to torment ESPECIALLY people who are trying to do their best."

@BrianHart-i6h,In conjunction with The Holy Spirit Jordan shows a oneness<br>As a loving father that few in the situations of our civil and socialized lives failed to have due to life&#39;s continuom of young unwise parents raising children upon viewpoints and truths which are not necessarily true yet social construct which caused more harm than good with good potential intent or maybe not? <br>Thank you Jordan for speaking up and leading and thank you to the intelligent hosts....this one and others. <br>Keep up the good fight . Bless all in The Name of Jesus. The Truth is the Way

@morten3465,"A lot of this resonates, but the whole meta-intellectual refuting of being able to orient yourself by facts because the facts are too many, too disputed and in need of hierarchy =&gt; the bible has all the answers (around 2h00m). It&#39;s like the mirror image of left-wing public discourse where examining facts humbly is replaced with an orthodoxy of which facts you are supposed to prioritize or reject, which JP criticizes extensively. That is a weird blind spot in my view."

@Lisas4us,"Dear Jordan,  just some questions regarding mental health in the young. You use a lot of generalizations that makes me a bit uncomfortable. Why would you think one could not be happy in the absence of a stable relationship. Just because you would be unhealthy and unhappy without one, why do you project that on every other person in the world?  You have to be married to find purpose and  meaning, you said, isn&#39;t that a bit single minded? Why does a life like a Penguin is better than a life like a fish? Why  do you think someone thinking about him or herself must be miserable, I am certainly not one of those people. You might, hence your drive and energy and your tenacity to do what you do must come from somewhere, and it seems it comes  not from your happiness and contentedness.  And obviously, it doesn&#39;t make you healthier or happier either, right?  Sometimes I think, you are very convinced of your own convincing."

@TwistVinicius,Peterson is so wise.
@timbutler3931,"Thank you! Jordan Peterson for being a man of great truth! I love the heart years you wrestled in telling the truth to us and especially the difficulty and war in our own hearts! And unlike Democrats, many Republicans, and American fools you have come to believe there is God and a Biblical moral right and wrong set of rules that we must live by to be blessed.     I thank God for that!    But, there is one more final rung in the ladder that will get you and all whoever will to becoming a child of God bound for Heaven. Actually, Jesus called that rung the  Chief Corner Stone of the building that most of us missed!     When I was a mentally behind child of six years old, My unreligious parents made me attend an old small school building Sunday School. Two old women would come out from town teach Bible stories. We learned about verses in John 3  and 14:6 and  Romans 3:23 and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEP5ubPMGDU&amp;t=383"">6:23</a>  then Matthew 7:13-14 and best of all Romans 10:8 to 15 and Revelations 3:20 and lots more.   What really happened to me was, I was all alone sleeping one night in bed, and this Being came into the room and woke me up and said those words those two old women said! So I asked &quot;Jesus&quot; to forgive my sins and to come into my heart and be my Lord and save me from my sins.  I could then remember this feeling of a warm light going inside me! I will never forget that!  At that time I was given the &quot;free gift&quot; of Salvation, forever loved child of &quot;God&quot;!   Despite abuse and a lot of blackness I was a very evil childhood and sick adult asshole, and you would not believe the amount of bones busted and rocks thrown at me! In every incident I eventually have to confess my evil and ask His forgiveness and come back to loving obedience. Yep! like you say. You still got to tell your self the truth and do the right loving thing in thanks of the love &quot;Jesus&quot; suffered and paid on the cross for our sins to our everlasting Father child relationship with &quot;God&quot;!   Yep!  &quot;Jesus&quot; made it very clear that every every every one is born an asshole sinner destined for Hell!  Without that knowledge fact, what &quot;God&#39;s&quot; love did dying on the cross for our sins would be nullified. You know what &quot;Jordan&quot;?  You and I know that the forensic literature evidence proves that &quot;Jesus&quot; healed thousands and thousands people and did all those miracles. With that being true, then the words &quot;Jesus&quot; said are true. &quot; He who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has believed in the only begotten  &quot;Son&quot; of &quot;God&quot;. And with that being true, those who are involved in treason murder and setting up world Communist government will suffer in hell for eternity, unless they believe the words of &quot;Jesus&quot;  by checking out the Scriptures!         Jordan!  You need to be &quot;Born Again&quot; like &quot;Jesus&quot; said and receive His free gift of Salvation not of works. Then the true relationship starts!  Never to be lost!  I hope you don&#39;t be a  &quot;shithead&quot; as I have been!  Love ya  Tim"
@bruceclark3292,"6 years ago, I met what would turn out to be the most influential mentor (in a business sense) that I could have hoped for.

He helped me solidify the idea that I had long before his influence that my only competition was and is the man I was in times past.<br>Then, I was blessed to find Dr. Peterson. His influence has pushed me deeper (much) into my self-awareness to not only make positive change in myself but <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEP5ubPMGDU&amp;t=1174"">19:34</a> also know why it had to change.

@FoodFreedomUSA,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEP5ubPMGDU&amp;t=10033"">2:47:13</a> Women go through this too Chris. Because society doesn‚Äôt tell us the truth anymore. We are told to chase and value external things (fitness, money, status). But those are not the things that bring true meaning and value to your life because they are not the deep purpose and pursuit of Truth in life. God, marriage, and family are the foundation, the rest is what you feed the marriage and family to elevate those things through the highest purpose. I‚Äôm a woman and had the same thing happen at 28. I had all the external accomplishments, but I was miserable and lonely. It wasn‚Äôt until I discovered the truth in God and pursued marriage in a Godly way. It took me 4 years of celibacy and study, but at 32 I married the man who perfectly completes me. 11 years later I‚Äôve become a happy, actualized wife. The pursuit of Truth and Order (God) must ALWAYS come first if you want true happiness and a meaningful life."

@bryanharoldfuller2657,"It was the council of Nicea which chose from all available  scriptures, the ones that would be used and the ones not used, (it&#39;s something close to 48 books that were left out&quot;missing&quot; of th Bible.)and what order to use them to create the Narrative  of the Bible. It was Constantine  of Rome who ordered all the highest Bishops to go through all the scriptures and do so. He basically locked them all in a room and said &quot;don&#39;t  come out until you&#39;re  done.&quot; He was tired a different sect of teachings being preached to the people on every other corner of the streets of his city. Another fun fact. The word God, is actually a  6th century Germanic word of origin, first appearing  in the Code Argenteus. That&#39;s  6th century A.D., 500 years after the time of Jesus, over 1500 from Moses and Abraham  and was even after the Council of Nicea. It was the when King James it translated that the word GOD, was interjected."

@Matthew.Sadecky,"JP. is really smart and interesting, but also seriously indoctrinated by man-god religious theology. &quot;You have to be married as a pre-condition to successful adaptation as a young adult?&quot; That is way out in the religious left field guys. Marriage means oneness at the core, it does not mean to a spouse for your whole life only. You can be very successful in all aspects of life without ever being married. I was able to listen to this until the middle, and it really starts getting religiously dogmatic more and more as you listen. He is actually exposing himself as believing everyone should have the same &quot;model for life&quot; that he does. That&#39;s a sad revelation for me because I love JP regardless of his indoctrination. He is in the spotlight for deeper exposure than he may realize at a spiritual level.

@levity90,"Something I struggle with immensely, and I have ever since I was a child, is extreme empathy for others who are suffering and the utter indifference of most people around me to these things. Especially the indifference of friends, family, partners, etc. I was vegetarian for a very long time because I could not tolerate the idea of contributing to a horrendous industry that causes so much unspeakable suffering. As a child I would stand up for other children who were being bullied even if it was at my own expense. I did this without thinking. <br><br>I will happily give the few dollars I have in my pocket to help someone on the street and not think twice about it. <br><br>And for as much compassion as I have for others, I have an equal amount of coldness and indifference to people I want to be close with. I find it very difficult to make friends and friends that I had I pulled away from. I didn&#39;t have enough in common with them and I grew bitter of what I perceived to be their selfishness and apathy for things that mean so much to me. Even if they were in other ways &quot;good&quot; people. Even better than me in some ways. More polite, sociable, etc. <br><br>I recently befriended someone at work and was completely turned off by her unwillingness to tip a delivery driver well. Especially considering the fact that the company we work for pays for our lunch. All she needed to do was throw in a couple of dollars to give a halfway decent tip and she wasn&#39;t willing to do that. And I find behavior like this to be the norm - not the exception. And I simply have no tolerance for it anymore. But it&#39;s leaving me isolated and increasingly bitter and cold. And I don&#39;t know honestly how to deal, as ridiculous as that might sound. I want to just turn off the part of my brain that has any desire to connect with others at all. I feel like I have an incredibly compassionate heart but my exterior is callousing over to the point where I truly hate people. And I don&#39;t want to."

@ZaKrakilla,"9 in 10 cases competence is actually just privilege and others were more suited for the job, this is something JB loves to ignore. People should be resentful and hateful when they see how others get 100 chances in their lives without even trying, while people that break their backs 24/7 don&#39;t get one single chance to have a decent life. You should be resentful, and you should go against the world. Why? Because that shows you don&#39;t live in a right world where people are treated fair, but you just live in a world where they sustain the illusion that people are treated right and fair. For someone obsessed with the truth, when it comes to fairness and what are the real chances for most people to go up the leader, JB doesn&#39;t care so much about truth, but cares very much for you to serve by the rules that others already made up for you, meant to keep you silent and in the mud. He used to care about fairness before getting these billionaires and famous people as friends. Now he decided it is better to serve the group and the truth can wait for the next generation."
@francesnance9110,"Loved everything about his video. However - at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEP5ubPMGDU&amp;t=8537"">2:22:17</a> - Chris introduces 5 questions to ask yourself if it&#39;s time to end a relationship. Jordan answers in his typical brilliant way. Yet, he does not take into consideration that if one is considering to end their relationship after they answer these questions, the possibility exists that their partner could be mentally unstable, such as abusive, narcissistic, passive aggressive, etc. Most of us are not equipped to work with another person brings those traits to the relationship, and exiting is the best self-preservation strategy in this case, IMHO."
@meinungabundance7696,&quot;To invent yourself anew&quot;?  What is it? A kind of &quot;tabula rasa&quot; project like in Russian communistic education? <br>This is also soo American and so naive - if you take into consideration that there exists something like genetics and predisposition! You cannot make yourself to what you want. Dr. Peterson should know that (for example) traits of temperament are mostly innate traits that we are born with.

Dr. Peterson has helped me to understand my husband&#39;s struggles better along with his needs.The information he&#39;s provided has helped me to be a better person, wife, and mother. I was the absent one in our marriage at times and I am now so wonderfully present. It pains me to think how much I neglected my husband emotionally off and on over the years. I truly enjoy my husband and we&#39;ve chased each other for 24 years straight. Lol. However, now the difficult days are much better and I am more attentive. I pray we have many more years of new material from Dr. Peterson and his beautiful family."
@Jordy_NL,"It is amazing how dr.

@anosh88,"I have all three books from Dr. Peterson, and they are phenomenal. He really is a great mind and has huge expertise in the field of psychology and the way the mind operates. However, his twentieth century philosophy doesn&#39;t really apply in a 21st century dating world. Having success in relationships isn&#39;t simply a matter of individual efforts, though there is nothing wrong with overcoming your fear of approaching others and being rejected. We have a more societal issue that seems to largely disadvantage men but not so much women.<br><br>Until he can start delving more deeply into such issues, his solutions fall on deaf ears for the most part because these advices he gives are just a form of beating a dead horse. I know he&#39;s not a sociologist, but I think he needs to be more educated on topics relating to dating and mating success for younger people. It is precisely at this point where I stop listening to Peterson&#39;s advice because even though he genuinely comes from a good place, he is largely ignorant and a bit naive when it comes to the necessary ingredients for success in dating, especially for younger men.<br><br>I don&#39;t entirely blame him though. I also certainly understand why so many young men flock to toxic characters such as Tate and Fresh and Fit. At least they are offering concrete solutions instead of just philosophical insights and musings. Each person makes their own choice in this area, but I personally have given up on dating because while I understand the benefit of it, it&#39;s largely a waste of time because you are getting a raw deal as a man in today&#39;s society.<br><br>Most women (and even most men) don&#39;t actually value men; instead, we&#39;re seen as expendable. We must be at the beck and call of women and children, but we won&#39;t even get a thank you. Instead, it&#39;s seen as our duty. However, when things go south, men are the first ones to be blamed. This sort of hypocrisy translates into the marriage dynamics where the wife pretty much has total control over the husband, and many men are utterly powerless if they were to be accused of any serious misconduct.<br><br>Therefore, given these realities, it is better to be alone, but I know most men and women have a strong and burning desire to be coupled up because being alone is tough. It is not an enjoyable place to be, especially if that is not what one desires. Nonetheless, I see it as a better alternative to navigating the minefield of dating and female psychology. It is a job that has no breaks, you must continue to be on the clock. Women don&#39;t have to worry about these things because they aren&#39;t required to understand men. Hence why I think being alone is a preferable option unless societal change occurs, which is probably not going to happen anytime soon."

@TheSpicyLeg,"When I was a young man, I was a womanizer and I used pickup artist strategies. From 18 to 26 I slept with over 250 women, and like Dr. Peterson says, you start to have that guy that talks to girls, and that guy you are alone, at home. What I found is that I had very low self-esteem and thought of myself as a loser and fake, because I was faking it. I was very lonely because I could not let a woman get close to me or she‚Äôd realize I was fake and putting on a show. You lie, trick, and worst of all, start to have negative feelings towards women in general because they become a threat to your game. They might see through you. <br><br>I began drinking heavily, even during the week. One day I was drinking and had taken a woman home when I saw a church. For whatever reason I felt compelled to go in. It was empty, but I sat in the church for 4 hours or so when a pastor showed up. He knew I had been drinking and told me I can sleep in one of the offices if I wanted to, and he wouldn‚Äôt call the cops or anything. So, I did. In the morning I woke up and left, couple days later I came back to thank him. He told me God was there for me, I need only ask. That night, I did, and I never drank again nor slept with a woman (beside my wife). That was 15 years ago."

@thomasculpovich379,I found a single thing that I disagree with based off personal experience. He says women look at money in a relationship based off the characteristics a financially stable person has. I don‚Äôt think we can give that much credit to the average person. In my personal experience/empirical evidence. That‚Äôs quite literally the peak of intelligence and emotional intelligence in people. I don‚Äôt think people take those things into account till they‚Äôve been enlightened a bit. It seems to me that we aren‚Äôt taking long term effects into account when making short term actions. For a woman to take a man‚Äôs financial stability and turn that into character traits would be one hell of a woman.

@wowomah6194,"To the first part of what Peterson says, this is the plot of the movie Hook totally. Robin Williams plays Peter Pan who has become entirely cynical after escaping from his naivete as Peter Pan as a boy. He comes to the real world out of Neverland and ends up falling in love and becoming a lawyer. But he becomes obsessed with his job, starts missing important life events, loses joy in life, loses real connection with others, loses himself, and starts to become more and more bitter and jaded about things large and small. But then he returns to Neverland to save his kids (who Hook kidnapped to lure him back for one last fight because Hook is frankly what Robin Williams&#39; character was becoming: cynicism and nihilism itself...life is nothing but hedonism, arrogance, power. For Hook, is is FUN to ruin others&#39; joy and freedom, but maybe not so much fun as it is his DUTY. Childhood whims are to be crushed and put to the sword. And of course, the great symbology of the clock constantly ticking that drives Hook INSANE because he feels so close to death because once his own inner child had died, he lost all purpose and meaning and the clock was a constant reminder of his mortality). <br><br>So Robin Williams returns and has to struggle with himself and the lost boys in order to remember finally, at long last, that he IS Peter Pan, that Peter Pan is still inside him. He is more than Peter Pan now but he remembers his &quot;happy thought&quot; now and after escaping his naivete and becoming cynical in the real world, now instead of returning to that naivete, he instead has found COURAGE in himself, in his life, and in valuing what life is really about. He isn&#39;t afraid to grow old and he isn&#39;t afraid to live in the NOW. And with that courage he literally remembers how to fly and fight and CROW like a rooster. Yeah I know it&#39;s silly but I think that movie also perfectly encapsulates what Peterson was describing there. In order to escape the jaded, painful, bitter cynicism of growing up and adulthood and feeling like a cog on a wheel, you have to dare stepping out and putting your heart on your sleeve and standing up for what you know to have meaning in life even if you cannot prove it, you must LIVE it without fear that you may be hurt if you put yourself out there like that. It is in that courage that you can actually become the master of your own life, otherwise, you end up just being a reactionary to your own emotions and whatever life throws at you. You have to be willing to embrace the chaos to some extent and be comfortable building a sandcastle knowing that there are tides all around you. You don&#39;t build the sandcastle because you think it will last forever, but because it MATTERS to you and you want to give something to others that will also inspire them to create meaning as well because then together, the meaning you create together in life will definitely conquer the nihilism and cynicism of adulthood."

@Faust_YT,You have more than what you believe.
@atomicvinylreviews3420,"I really like and respect Peterson, but he tends to loose me when he moves away from the more psychological stuff and starts talking about &quot;god&quot; <br>I&#39;m still trying to be open minded to what he&#39;s saying when he gets into all of that realm, but I still feel like his rational about the &quot;definition of god&quot; comes across as very similar to how feminists force &quot;feminism&quot; on to you by saying stuff like &quot;do you believe in equality between the genders? Than you&#39;re a feminist.&quot; ...<br><br>Even if I did accept that god is some kind of conceptual greatest good that we orient ourselves towards, than I certainly don&#39;t view that biblical judeo-christian god as being that way.<br>I don&#39;t believe in some kind of &quot;objective&quot; secular morality like Sam Harris, but I also don&#39;t believe. I do believe that morality is a real thing and that things are genuinely &quot;wrong, good and bad...&quot; but I believe that I feel that way not from any objective higher morality, but because my animal evolved brain, just like everyone, is hard wired to feel as if &quot;write, wrong, good and bad&quot; are objective... but I can also acknowledge that morality is arbitrary, from a technical perspective... meaning that &quot;good and bad&quot; doesn&#39;t exist in the universe outside of what are technically subjective feelings of living things. We evolved what we call &quot;morality&quot; through developing a sense of fairness and an adverseness to pain and and a sense of self preservation... and just like with every evolved trait it developed that way as those traits helped people reproduce and pass on those traits ...<br>Even on a much more blatant level large elements of morality are clearly subjective, person to person and culture to culture, what is moral and considered wrong can greatly vary and even the elements that don&#39;t too much tend to be on a spectrum and are very context dependent, that&#39;s why so many moral philosophies tend to clash and not agree, because they&#39;re not clear rules but more like guide lines that were only evolutionary pushed to certain limits historically so complex theoretical philosophical thought experiments get so morally messy really easily... <br><br>I think religion tends to corrupt and control and reproduces like a virus, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m really skeptical of how much Jordan reads into the bible, there&#39;s obviously good archetypal stories in there, but at what point do you draw the line where he&#39;s clearly arbitrarily reading what he wants into the text,which can just as easily be read in many often clearly dogmatic, dangerous and outdated ways...<br><br>Also Jordan&#39;s definition of things being &quot;real&quot; or &quot;more real than real&quot; feels very  dubious to me..."

@ambientlight3876,"I think why some hate Peterson is that he calls us to confront ourselves in a society where the sources of our suffering are always projected outward.  The victim mentality is very popular. The insidious nature of this mentality is that it doesn&#39;t solve the core causes of our suffering.   It just provides us with temporary false comfort and wrath towards others. Historically speaking,  this point results in death and devastation and opens us up to become pawns to truly manavolent forces that will use our projected anger to manipulate,  use and then dispose of us all for their gain."
@CdnEnjoyLife,"Jordan Peterson has incredible wisdom. YES, TAKE RISKS!<br><br>Personally, I believe that people nowadays are entitled, that is why singleness and divorce are so high. People are so spoiled that they think a 10/10 is every detail is going to ring their doorbell and miraculously be perfect. Being realistic means selecting a few areas that are most important, accepting compromise in other areas, in a person and actively seeking that person.<br><br> It&#39;s almost 2024, people are imperfect and will take effort to find. Life is short....spend your time working towards being someone that who you want, wants to be with. I am shocked with the amount of people that have &#39;option-itis&#39;....stay single/divorce to keep &#39;one-upping&#39; the previous relationship.....unattainable expectations lead to misery. <br><br>If the right woman/man lives in another area for example, move.....take a risk. It&#39;s one example. Stop seeking complete perfection people. God created us to desire relationships...not be alone."

The sinister influences of imperialism that have spread over the West since the dawn of the British Empire (now grown into the Anglo-American one) have infected every sector of our society. It is no wonder that our society is so fractured &amp; our  youth is so despondent. These impacts are not accidental. Those who wield the power of Empire actively work to poison mankind physically, mentally, and spiritually in order to better enslave it. <br>People are starting to wake up.  Scientists are starting to push back against bad science. A better economic system is lighting the way in Asia, and people are turning back to God after having experienced the emptiness of individualism. <br>A whole new paradigm is dawning, and Jordan is at the forefront of that, creating new systems of education and governance. All of our institutions need to be reshaped. I work in &quot;healthcare,&quot; an Orwellian name if there ever was one. What we really have is a &quot;disease management&quot; system. <br>The relentless campaign of fear &amp; doom by the media is a signal of the desperation of our masters to cling to power because they can see it slipping from their hands. The Empire is crumbling. It&#39;s a time to rejoice and get to work rebuilding!"

The main message for me here is embracing the suffering and discomfort that is an inherent part of life, process, and the work it takes to become fully human. A worthwhile life is a sacrificial experience, sadly. Popular culture says we are free to do what we want, but are we really? If part of what we want can lead to undesired outcomes? The path of discipline and a level of &#39;taming the flesh&#39; seem to be what ultimately works.

@DR-cr3zo,"This is interesting but only helpful to men. Not women. I am a woman. I do not have sex outside of a committed relationship, all Ive wanted all my life was to settle down and get married and start a family. Without that, Ive known all my life I would be miserable, as I am now.  I have devoted my life to trying to build a family. Yet I have failed. I do not sleep around. I date a lot but do not sleep with anyone without clear long term committed. In my 20s 30s 40s almost any man I met didnt want to commit and those that did played games, were narcissistic and treated me horribly. I have lost some babies (had miscarriages)  in my last relationship as it was so unstable. I have never been with a man who man a good honest attractive man and wanted to commit to me. Looking at me you&#39;d be surprised. Im fit, perfect weight, naturally curvy and pretty face. I look young, I smile a lot. Im well educated and I also made wise investments so now Im rich. The only men I meet are either unattractive losers usually unemployed, or simply men who do not want to commit, or men with substance abuse issues. Ive probably been on 1000 first dates. I wonder what Jordan Peterson would tell me. he would be at a loss of words. He is clear that humans without a family are miserable. He is correct. But what happens when despite making this mission the main mission of your life, you have not managed. and now Im alone and sad at 50. I guess my only option is suicide because I dont want to live without being a mother and a wife."

@rr_mama9323,On a second note‚Ä¶Dr. Peterson. I am what I consider to be a strong person. I lost May parents at age 14 in a car accident. <br>I didn‚Äôt end up ‚Äúbad‚Äù. I chose to thrive despite the unfortunate circumstances despite others trying to keep me in ‚Äúthat role‚Äù. <br>This past year has been beyond trying. My marriage is struggling. I‚Äôm almost 44 and I was really at a loss with the way I was feeling. <br>I started my journey of ‚Äúnew self improvement‚Äù two years ago with CS Lewis ‚ÄúMere Christianity‚Äù. More self help books trying to take a hard look at myself and my life. <br>Your insight has truly saved me. I was at a very dark point and your words in 12 Rules for Life reawakened my will to thrive. <br>Each day is still rough but I keep listening and taking the hard look at myself and what I can and cannot control. <br>As a professional‚Ä¶your regulatory board needs to take a hard look in the mirror. <br>What have any of them contributed to society? What have any of them done to challenge the misconceptions that our culture fosters? That‚Äôs is the goal of psychology correct? To challenge the construct of thought and behavior towards a higher quality(a debatable construct I‚Äôm aware) of overall society health. <br>So challenge them. We will all willingly stand up for you. I would gladly present my credentials and my experience to stand against the tyranny they are attempting to subject you to.
@rr_mama9323,Dr. Peterson. I‚Äôm sure you will never see this. I first learned of Carl Jung during an ethics class at my community college for nursing. I‚Äôm now a nurse practitioner and do consider his main theory on a regular basis. So please know that those some of us that paid attention in our required ‚Äúextra‚Äù theory classes do recognize the importance in daily interpersonal interactions.

@Io-Io-Io,"He&#39;s a theorist and not a bad one at that, but I was not amused when he blocked me three times on twitter. Once for questioning what Israel is doing in Gaza now, and the other two for challenging him on a made statement, not by insulting but rather by questioning.<br> That seems pretty shallow of him and I know of many others who got blocked recently, not just muted but blocked, meaning they cannot see the tweets any longer- what good is that?...<br>People who have been listening for years now, translating, even posting lectures on youtube, which nobody else did, to the acclaim of hundreds of thousands of listeners. Don&#39;t know what he&#39;s going through at the moment, but, I for my part, hardly ever block anyone, I just mute them. Why should they not be allowed to see my tweets anymore?...<br>We&#39;re all flawed and so is he of course, still- mute, Jordan, don&#39;t just block, if someone challenges you on twitter, it doesn&#39;t have to mean they think ill of you, even if their accounts have nicknames instead of real names, as they may have been created over a decade ago and it doesn&#39;t automatically mean they&#39;re all &#39;demons&#39;..

@D3cast,"Chris when you talk I think you should go just a bit more into your own subjective experience. An example is around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEP5ubPMGDU&amp;t=9959"">2:45:59</a> . I think there were some uncovered golden nuggets underneath the surface there in your experience. What didn&#39;t you value? Why? How did you come to those realizations. I know its a tough field to navigate doing a podcast, juggling the whole convo, I just think there is more value in what you have to share overall and I feel like you don&#39;t give enough credit for it."

@kevinjohnson1427,"Nobody will probably comment on this, but Jordan smoked? I consider smoking to be one of the most disgusting things a person can do. They intentionally harm themselves and don&#39;t have any consideration whatsoever for others&#39; health. Intentionally inhaling poison into your lungs cannot be described as anything but suicidal.  I don&#39;t care whatsoever if it is &quot;addictive&quot;. I believe smokers to be demons. Smokers probably drink piss. Drinking piss water is no different than inhaling poison air. I am sad to hear Jordan once smoked."

I had hedonistic desires. I ended up in hell as a result. I over analyzed the situation and continually talked myself into sticking with it for some time (after all I finally got what I always wanted why wasn‚Äôt I finally happy) and it just made me blind to God‚Äôs will and to reality. I am trying to pick up the pieces now. I am glad I found God through this crisis when everything fell apart. And thankful for Jordan and his family. Thanks Chris for this great interview I think I will listen to it again sometime."

@meetangad,Listening to Dr. Peterson is surreal in itself. What a god given gem this man is..
@AlissiaBell,One point about stating there was some level of success when a man got a fake number. No. It means the man was significantly frightening enough for a woman to be too afraid to tell him no.

These treasures in heaven, the discarnate state, serve as landmarks by which to orient and by focus constrain the spirit which naturally seeks to expand, even to the point of dissipation. &quot;Believe and you&#39;ll be saved&quot;?!

@jamesbell8861,I was such an insecure young man ... I would lie about my life to anyone that would listen.  Such a hard habit to break.  I still catch myself doing it at 50+ years old.  At least I found a partner that calls me out when I pull that crap in front of her.  It&#39;s ridiculous.
@Tenzin62,"I‚Äôm 61 and my life is over before it‚Äôs begun. Only one good thing ever happened to me in my life. The rest, all of it has been sh*t. Two years ago doctors thought I had cancer. Myeloid leukaemia, when he was steeling himself to break the ‚Äòbad news‚Äô I felt happy. I saw it as a clean easy way out instead of suicide., which would have been an unpleasant death for my family. He misdiagnosed me, it was anaemia. Life is sh*t, gratitude is impossible. Anything I get hopeful gets shot down. It‚Äôs been that way my whole life. It will never change."

@lynncarter4964,"As an agnostic, searching for ways to find faith if it truly is possible,  I try to see how the bible fits in where nothing else can.  But I just can&#39;t see it. However I love how JP has made changes in this world that noone else has,  and I think we should all listen to what he says and apply it practically. The relationship with a higher being is a good thing,  for me the higher being is not from the bible,  so let what JP teaches move all of us in whatever way it is meant to.  We must listen to the underlying message of taking responsibility, and not allowing our humanity to be removed from us.  THanks for this interiew,  we are all on a learning journey."

@villevanttinen908,"There is no free will, so I can&#39; t decide to stop &quot;wasting&quot; my life. Peterson offers metaphysical implication about  life saying life is &quot; suffering&quot;, which smells like priest, but is it? Or should it be? Maybe for some people it really is, but for Peterson himself? Is he Really suffering himself, ever has? Anyway saying life is suffering is just one intepretation, so. metaphysical implication."

It got me from utterly lost, with my family carrying me along, to trying to help my wife and kids every day. I&#39;m not well, but I&#39;m trying, and helping my family.

@MonkeyKong21,"that&#39;s interesting to hear about oldschool pickup artistry focusing on pretending.  The only pickup artist people I heard from were, around maybe 2018, focusing on specific ways to make yourself better and understand interaction/conversation from the woman&#39;s perspective, mostly through case study/workshopping/ real world examples.  It gave suggestions and understanding of things you might do in different chatting/dating situations, but all meant to be authored by you, honestly and in the moment.  They even catered to the real viewpoint of 90% of the audience who only wants to use this for good (i.e. creating a lifelong, excellent, monogamous relationship)<br><br>Watching probably 10-20 hours of this on youtube was extremely helpful to me, has lead me to remedy a hopeless situation into an idyllic situation, and I&#39;d say it&#39;s worth looking into, but I guess take it with a grain of salt as well"

@charleyhinton1,Such a fantastic discussion! One of my new favorites.
@NikkiLRussell,I also recently realized something about WILL.. what will be will be. Everything that can happen will and will i be a willing participant or will I be a reluctant participant either way I will articulate and participate knowingly or not. Will our will is not always The creators will for us but it is in his creation parameters for being. Scenario‚Ä¶ In the beginning your actions reflect rebellious willful ignorance which becomes willful stupidity on many levels. When one knowingly runs away from the truth  being directed right to their psyche they are stupid the deciding factor is the KNOWING! If you know and continue insanely you‚Äôre stupid! If you do not know you don‚Äôt know and you ask another who doesn‚Äôt know you both are ignorant to it but you are looking for the reality of something so you‚Äôre inner existence feels something off with the ignorance and want to know why. <br>My ex said do you hear me and I said nope. I didn‚Äôt because he was not speaking nor was he being genuine but rather playing games and I knew it so I said naw I don‚Äôt hear ya. As I projected he continued playing and I finally a few weeks later said yeah I hear you I‚Äôve heard you for months and I let him know what I heard from his actions and I don‚Äôt think it bode well that he had to realize he was playing with himself and the woman he was using still is to get at me! Thing is I don‚Äôt care!

@antonioojeda6457,"I think Peterson&#39;s perspective on ideals appears to align with Plato&#39;s view of them being &#39;more real&#39; than physical forms, but he inverts Plato&#39;s stance on the relationship between the material and ideal realms. Plato posits that the eternal essence precedes and is more purely reflected in ideal forms than in their imperfect physical counterparts. In this view, the ideal mirrors the essence, contrary to Peterson&#39;s interpretation where the essence seems to emanate from the ideal."
@michaeldehart3253,"I like a lot of what Peterson says and what he puts out in the world, but I‚Äôm not sheepish enough to notice that from time to time he likes to serve up word salad. Sam Harris, who I agree with on a few things as well, took him to task a few times."

However, when he pivots into philosophy, religion and apologetics seem to be more like trying to find justification for what subconsciously he realizes have very little merit and hence require jumping through multiple intellectual hoops, undermining science (upon which he himself seems to be basing a lot of his insights), making grand claims about things he doesn&#39;t understand (astrophysics). Everything to explain come up the &quot;ideal&quot; and universal framework for how a hierarchy of values is constructed in societies.

I think it&#39;s important to acknowledge the good things people do that&#39;s something i learned from Jordan Peterson. This podcast summarized everything i asked for, i know i&#39;ve watched jordan peterson for so many years but i have a hard time applying his psychological advice even if i know for sure it&#39;s the right thing to do, and i really really want to, watching this summarzied every possible thing i struggle with. Thank you Chris, this will be the episode i will keep rewatching it&#39;s literally a summarization of who Jordan Peterson actually is. Such a beautiful and wonderful episode."
@StoneShards,"&quot;Always tell the truth&quot;, is probably not exactly correct: &quot;Do not speak falsely&quot;--including to yourself--because there are special consequences for speech, especially brutally honest speech. You know what words mean for you, but for others you can&#39;t know for sure, so it can be unfair to speak what you think is the brutally honest truth to everyone. You are guaranteed to be misunderstood, rendering you a liar in another&#39;s eyes, engendering a variety of real-world consequences...all due to original error. Generally, the less said, the better for you, but maybe not best for others. The original error could probably be corrected, enabling error-free communication."
@StoneShards,"Balance makes the cynic cynical about his own cynicism. Delusion is the fantasy you believe to be fact. Fantasy is the fundamental psychical balancing mechanism. The basis of fantasy is &quot;imagination&quot;, the creative facility of awareness, which is used to instantiate symbol systems, that, in their turn constitute control interfaces to the emotional layer of psyche. This is the pattern of all &quot;self-control&quot;. From the perspective of awareness, the &quot;unknown&quot; is the inchoate,  imperfectly formed or developed; disordered or incoherent...a random seethe of possibility, potential. Striking a balance means comparing a particular &quot;known&quot; to a relevant &quot;unknown&quot;, observing and identifying associations as they arise in response to the character of the contact with the &quot;unknown&quot;. Step by step, you clothe the unknown in images known only to you. The pattern of these images forms a symbol that represents particular knowledge--the unknown has, thus, been actualized, becoming &quot;known&quot;. Continuing the process, the border of the &quot;unknown&quot; is pushed back, as disorder is ordered in experience. The pressure of disorder liberates order from its own tyranny, perfection of order."

@mattjohnson9727,"As a parent of a tyrannical 13 month old (about <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEP5ubPMGDU&amp;t=8760"">2:26:00</a>), I&#39;ve wrestled with figuring out what the proper behavior is to expect out of an infant/toddler as they develop. I&#39;ve looked to research of traditional hunter gatherer groups and mostly found that children sleep with their parents and breastfeed commonly until 3 years of age if not more, but little about when they should be expected to know how to behave. I think that fussing/crying is often a sign that they need emotional connection and comfort at that moment, but can become control/tyranny at a certain point as well, and I&#39;m terrified of neglecting that need before they are neurologically ready to handle it or comforting them longer than is appropriate. I know Jordan has said if they aren&#39;t socialized by 4 years then you might as well forget about it, but I&#39;m curious of more specific recommendations. Does anyone have opinions/comments or resources that they would like to share of similar scenarios? I would love to have a discussion if anyone has anything."

@joarsolbakk7160,"Really enjoyed the interview! But i do somewhat disagree with the self-consciousness and negativity connection you made. I think i do understand where you are coming from though. Say through self-conscious reflection you reach a point of &quot;destroying&quot; beauty, where the sequences of reflecting lead you to some greater abstraction, say, &quot;devoid&quot; of positive feeling - I look at this as an integration of that reflective process, which effectively makes it not self-conscious, and then at the same time harmonious with where ever you are situated. <br>But what ive come to ponder upon alot for these past years is on the relation between pleasure (short term beauty if can call it that) and foresight (the integrated sequence that has its root in self-reflection)(this is from Jung and im not sure im using these terms correctly). I do think that self-reflection can bring about positive feeling, but there might be some nuances connected to the self-reflective process that unfolds. <br><br>Words and truth - I do believe words can capture reality and give some stability, but im inclined to believe that words are only as true as the context that they are used in. They need time to be processed and brought to light - as the meaning of words lie beyond them. In my mind you have here a distinction between pragmatism and idealism. In other words a distinction between a deep understanding of a process as is, and the other as a theoretical framework (an aesthetic one at that). <br><br>I see the positive in this, follow your feelings.<br>Sad i missed your show in my home city!"

@briansteagall350,"On naivety and optimism and cynicism, it actually doesnt matter if things can get better or not. You have to act as though they can.

If things can&#39;t get better and you behave as though they can, they may or may not be marginally better on a personal level, but you also reclaim some agency and hope for the future, even if its misplaced, and that is still better than being swallowed by a void of hopelessness. <br><br>If things can get better and you act as though they can&#39;t, you&#39;ve wasted your life, given up your agency, abdicated responsibility, and actively made things worse than they could have been by not striving to make things better.

@annalpha1,"Ok I do love Jordan Peterson and his thoughts normally resonate with me, YET I really strongly disagree with his theory of people embracing the ONS or the non-monogaomous lifestyle. His reasoning here is unbelievably simplistic and so far removed from the societal context we live in. There are so many factors which he is completely ignoring. He sounds like someone who stopped dating about 40 years ago and has zero understanding of the modern dating scene. Saying that psychopaths, narcissists, sadists and machiavellians are the only types that will embrace that lifestyle is just borderline ridiculous and almost makes me question the validity of everything else he says. First off often ONS normally happen between people who BOTH want that! It is very much a two ways thing. On top of this, what about the people who struggle to find anyone to fall in love with because it&#39;s not exactly the thing that happens that often? What about the people who have very high standards and who will never settle for less? What about the people who value their own freedom over a family or stable partner, but still very naturally and healthily crave sex? What about the people who don&#39;t believe we were ever meant to be monogamous in the first place, as most other animals aren&#39;t? What about the fact that life will give you whatever it is meant to give you and it&#39;s up to you to ride the wave enjoying every minute taking everything as an opportunity to live, love, grow, experience and feel? I am spotting a huge underdevelopment / childlike attitude in his way of seeing life and definitely a lack of spirituality and greater understanding of life and its non-palpable rules and meanings. I thought he was clever but his extreme vision on this point makes him come across like a bit of an idiot...."

@guzgrant,"Cynicism as he describes it is post modernism  existentialism bordering on nihilism born out of the loss or driving out of spirituality and it‚Äôs limited to the ironic descriptive .<br>Beyond that there is the New sincere , which is normative it has hopes ,suggestions  and answers and is redemptive .<br>It‚Äôs fair to say the popularity of podcasts comes from the alienation caused by out increasingly busy lifestyles and technology .

@REV009,"Peterson seems skeptical of science, skeptical of university, and everything goes back to a bible story.

@michaelknight4041,"One of the first, and probably still the most, really disagreeable persons that i got to know well was a man i worked closely with at my old job. He was sort of the head electrician and programmer at a large manufacturing facility where i was an electrician. The nature of my job required me to work closely with him and even though he wasn&#39;t my direct supervisor i still sort of answered to him just because he was over most of the work i would be doing. Even though he was notoriously difficult i was always kind of fascinated by him just because i am the exact opposite of that personality type. He was combative, often rude, competitive, driven to succeed, even at the expense of others, and almost never showed any empathy or even seemed to give a second thought as to how his behavior effected others. It served him well. He had worked his way into a very good position in the company and had made himself so integral to the place that those above him believed he was irreplaceable. This was partly true because he was great at his job, but it was also because he didn&#39;t mind telling people how great he was, or demonstrating it, or just bullying people if he felt they were challenging him. He would sometimes get into screaming matches with people in meetings and such if he thought they were challenging him. He was probably the only person that could get away with that type of behavior there. It was often comical and we would sometimes have competitions to see who could piss him off with the least amount of words. I always got along good with him though, i genuinely liked him and i also knew it was in my best interest. I dont think ive ever met anyone to this day quite like him but it was an interesting experience to meet someone so far on the other end of the spectrum from myself."

@SuperAceman007,"I love Peterson and always have but occasionally I can see that he has a poor attitude towards strong men.  Like for instance, he says that back in high school he was attempting to get in shape so he took up swimming then started lifting weights but then he says a muscle headed monster tried to give him advise on how to work out properly.  Jordan had disdain for this man and his attempt.  If his description of the event is accurate then what does this say about him?  Once again, I am a Jordan fan but I am also a critical thinker."

@toddashley407,I gotta just say it cause it&#39;s been gnawing at me for some time...<br><br>I love Jordan he is a gift to humanity.  BUT like everyone he ain&#39;t perfect and still has room to grow.  In his case it&#39;s theology. If I could humbly suggest anything to him it would be to go out and get a NONDENOMINATIONAL christian theology degree.  I stress that it must not be one linked to a specific denomination but one that is truthfully critical of all denominations (including Roman Catholicism) from a perspective that men who create denominations are flawed.  I think this is critical for him in what appears to be his struggles in this realm.  He is so close to getting there it&#39;s sad to me.  He needs to get himself out of the boxes he has created for himself in this area.  He actually advocates for such an approach in this very talk in a number of realms except for this one.  I say this as someone who has wrestled with this issue myself and wants what is best for Jordan.  He would be exponentially more helpful than he already is if he did so.<br><br>Praying for you Jordan - I can see you struggling and I believe you will succeed in these areas you are contending with.<br><br>Excellent talk one of the best I have seen from Jordan - I&#39;ve watched Jordan for years I love how he himself lives what advocates and is constantly growing himself!

@fightswithspirits915,"Thank you for this.  Will never forget feeling true gratitude for the first time.  50 years old.  A virus in the brain evicted my mind.  The Self was sent to an infinite abyss of nothingness where darkness doesn&#39;t even exist and from where nothing ever returns.  I woke.  Fell to all fours and sobbed with the knowledge a protective force violated laws of the Universe to return who I was to this body.  Gratitude, especially because I knew in my heart it was not just not deserved, it was undeserved.  Where did my mind go?  What exactly returned?  Was it the Singularity?  Was it part of the child version of me that had been filed away at 8 for very good reason?  Was it all of this?  Or was my mind simply backed up to my DNA or other structure then restored to the brain when the coast was clear?  Was it none of this?  <br><br>My personality is simply a narcissistic disordered chunk of default brain space with a handful of scripts,  gifted with solving problems.  The coma experience enhanced my gift.  How disappointing to learn I had no soul.  No capability to love.  <br><br>The message from God.  A task to perform.  An impossible task because it requires love.  No redemption regardless of outcome.  If the task was completed, in that moment, instantly, I cease to exist.  Nothing more than backspaced letters on a word processor CRT.  Once backspaced they can never return.<br><br>Back to the abyss.  The best thing about infinite nothingness is having no existence to worry about existing or not."

@sethrenville798,"Why do I like this guy, I personally disagree wholeheartedly with his argument for the existence of God, and here&#39;s why. I think there is a very large epistemological hole in that I think his whole essence of good argument is based on a fallacy in that if there is some objective good, which I don&#39;t think there is, but rather, everytbing is completely subjective (but thats just a personal belief) that there must be a being who personifies the essence of that goodness, which is a HUGE logical leap. <br><br> And that there has to be some sort of God in order to live a moral life is really bullshit. I like that he says that you should be good not out of fear of punishment, but simply being good for the sake of goodness, but that seems to contradict him thinking that there is an association of the existence of this God that he speaks of. <br><br> Personally, I do think that there is some type of being like that out there, but his argument is holier then Jesus&#39;s hands."

@u4iadreams,"The advice of not comparing yourself to others falls flat in a capitalistic society. Our society is inherently competitive and if you are not better than the competition, you don&#39;t get the reward of getting the money you need to live. Do both. Compare yourself to everyone and everything to get an honest assessment of what it takes to get where you want to be. This is the path to success."

@TRayTV,"The first hour was good.  Where he went off the rails for me was at about the 87 minute mark.  Talking about relationships in imperatives just reminds me that Peterson&#39;s goal is to maintain the status quo no matter the cost.  Society and the socio-economic machine need its fodser.  And Peterson is here to make sure the hierarchy has plenty of willing epsilons to do the heavy lifting while the alphas enjoy the benefits.  And it&#39;s not really that he&#39;s wrong, it&#39;s more that he&#39;s willing, almost eager, to sacrifice  fairness for stability.  Where I object is that we are so estranged from economic fairness that the status quo NEEDS to be interrupted and something at least resembling &#39;adequate remuneration for value given&#39; needs to be restored [so that / before] participation in the socio-economic system makes sense.  People are sacrificing too much and getting too little so that those who hoard wealth can hoard even more.  This has been worsening for decades.  Being a good drone just exacerbates that.<br>If we were still living in the 1960s or even 80s Jordan&#39;s advice would be fine.  But in this day he&#39;s just telling us to mold ourselves to better fit the yoke."

@zangimike,"I recall my enthusiasm I had for college. Even did the whole, &quot;I&#39;m not going to be a loser again, no one will know me, it&#39;s a college that takes kids from all over.&quot;<br>I was told to do some extra-curricular activities/hobbies while going to my classes to diversify my strengths/network with others. Unfortunately the &quot;friends&quot; I have made at college were not good people. I was labeled a racist by most of my peers. Had two Gfs that didn&#39;t like being around me unless we were with friends, which quickly changed to promises of dates while they&#39;re busy with their guy friends. I was na√Øve at the time and didn&#39;t think anything about it. Yet the first person I met at college, who was in my head my best friend after a year, slept with both my girlfriends shortly after I introduced them to our clubhouse. Shortly after I was kicked out by everyone as I was an abusive partner to these women and lost quite a few possessions save my car and clothes. Which that wasn&#39;t true as I drove 30 miles north on my way back to my father&#39;s, my vehicle broke down. Just to discover my oil was low, just after I did a change a week prior. (Still not sure if someone fucked me on that last part, or if that was a genuine error on my end when I did the change).<br><br>tl;dr   I think everyone is overhyping the &quot;importance&quot; of interactions at college. It&#39;s a debt that I wish I never invested in.<br><br>Or this is just whining as common denominator of this is me. They&#39;re all still friends with one another, hanging out and what not. I&#39;m just no longer in that picture. Guess my question should be, how am I a racist and how can I stop that? Even the last attempt at dating, one date ended awkwardly, I couldn&#39;t figure out why. Until the next day, my door is banged on to the point I heard the hinges squeaking. Opened up to a knuckle sandwich and screams about if I ever try anything like that to her again, no one would be able to find my body. After hiding for a bit and using what little friends/family I had left to figure out what the fuck was happening. Turns out this girl was uncomfortable around me, she only said yes to a date out of pity. My attempt to hold her hand was crossing the boundaries and she felt like I had raped her...2014. I haven&#39;t even talked to a female since. Even with my own family, if there&#39;s a female I go silent and only respond through head nods while averting my gaze from their direction.<br><br>Sorry for long comment. Started with a &quot;oh yeah, I&#39;ve felt that and recognized the failures with that thought&quot; then just devolved into (what feels like) &quot;Oh woe is me, pity me please!&quot;<br>If that&#39;s the feeling you got from this, please humiliate me.

@SteveBonin,"Dr. Peterson, I understand that you are trying your best to put ideas out into the world that you feel are helpful for others to be able to dig themselves out of the depths of dispair, or just rise above the meaninglessness of daily drudgery -- your goals are laudable. (For context only, I describe myself as a spiritual warrior following in the ideas of Z&#39;ev ben Shimon Halevi, Gurdgieff, Ouspensky, Castaneda, and Migel Ruiz.) I submit, for your consideration: 1. The concept of Cognative Deprevation which occurs in very smart people, in that they have large well-categorized repositories of knowledge in their minds, and when new information is given to them, they liken this new information to something they already know and categorize the new information as, &quot;Oh, this is just the same as that.&quot; and don&#39;t examine the new information closely, and thus, they are cognitavley deprived of new ideas their &quot;guardian angel in conjunction with their soul&quot; is trying to bring them; and in this way these individuals cease to grow spiritually. 2. Life is about sacrifice, as you say, but the things that need offering up are the splinters of ego, the shadow selves, and Freudian unassimilated childhood wounding from your past. This gives rise to the concept of the &quot;Dark night of the Soul&quot; where when offering these up feels like a mini-death, and in a way it is, it is the Ego dying. 3. If you don&#39;t meditate, you cannot grasp the &quot;Urges of Your Soul&quot;, I urge you to call Sam Harris, read this post to him and listen to what he has to say. Respecfully submitted."

So to say that the reality in our &quot;collective skull&quot; could be more real to me is wrong.<br><br>If G√∂del teaches us anything about models of understanding, is that the model we create are by definition unperfect, and it could be this which helps us avoid ending in self-referential &quot;local minima&quot;.<br><br>Open to discussion :)"

The abyss of existence is that which we encapsulated in the beliefs of God.<br><br>God is nothingness, Nirvana is nothingness. Etc.<br><br>But! Nietzsche talks about what Peterson refers to god as the ultimate fictional character, where the imaginary and real collide, almost borderline insanity really.<br><br>This property of God according to Nietzsche, is why even atheists cannot dispense with god, for atheists are the most obsessed with god, but are confused about the nature of God.<br><br>Less confused about the nature of god than Christian‚Äôs and dogmatically pious people.

@kssthmn,"The oxymoron here, is you probably should state the title &quot;how to promote positive thinking&quot;. There&#39;s levels to negativity, as well as positivity. I personally find this a linear perspective, while not having watched the video, uninteresting. Merely due to Peterson&#39;s unconscious nihilism that i don&#39;t shame him in the slightest for attaining over his many years. Perhaps he would do well with some psychedelic voyages ü•∏ who can say, friends? Who can say... but yeah. In .y view, I&#39;m not obligated to do anything, though I feel obliged to follow my heart and gut and reunite connections lost, in whatever form. That to me sounds and rings true and meaningful."

@vasiapetrovi4773,&quot;pursuing the truth will set you free&quot; - what exactly is meant by these words? is there any meaningful implication to the world? There are many claims of Jordan that hang on loose claims like this. That is the reason i started to loose Peterson as a thinker

Based on women generally don‚Äôt have birth past the age of 40, they have to purely guess what will happen in 2080. They should be providing projections for the next 20 years based on current society and actual numbers and trends from the past 10 years and the trend of the trends for 10 year increments. This should be separated from the immigration trends and their birth rate input which probably isn‚Äôt traceable."

@matthost,Musk is conman not a genius.
@veronicab15,"One of the best episodes, hands down!"
@weelaad,why does Peterson have to make everything about the bible and use analogies and stories from religious texts that often don&#39;t really adress the question/point that was brought up in the best way
@zarathustra007,a great thinker and a great interviewer.
@waynevandalsum4291,"I&#39;m afraid I find a few of the things that Jordan states as a fait accomplis to be false here. E.g. people like Ellen deGeneris oder Jimmy Fallon would never have got where they are in a brutal business world of merciless competition if they were as nice and lovey dovey as their public persona. It&#39;s ridiculous to expect that. Business isn&#39;t good. Business eats up the good and spits them out. To get where they are, these people have to know evil and be capable of fighting."
@waynevandalsum4291,"Nor is death a punishment if you know it is followed by Heaven. The worst thing is the betrayal, and the horror that despite your suffering, humanity is not getting any closer to Heaven, which is the complete good that Jordan speaks of. The realisation that there is still evil and that we therefore have to keep going through these iterations of suffering before we can reach heaven is the horrible part, because Heaven - per definition - is the summum bonum or whatever he called it, and until everything is good, there will be no Heaven. That is why Jesus was sad, not because he was dying. That would be paradoxical."
@nonhodiesatanas,"Beyond the obvious that Jordan is one of the greatest minds of our time, he surely is a snappy dresser. Or maybe quirky is the word I am looking for...Regardless, the matching socks and tie are quite fun. The man has an unmatched sense of style."
@Derek_Stokes,My favorite part of this interview was Dr. Peterson saying he unwinds by watching Trailer Park Boys ü§£
@waynevandalsum4291,"As much as I enjoy Jordan, I disagree that God is the sum of all good. That is the definition of Heaven. God is quite obviously not only good if he enters into bets with the Devil to torture his most devout follower Job, or indeed if there is a Devil and a hell at all. God is everything, and not everything is good. If God were only good, there would not be anything. That is the goal, not God. Unless you say God and Heaven are the same thing, which I don&#39;t think people do. While of course God can say that any suffering that a human feels is insignificant when viewed in the context of infinity, it is, nonetheless, not good.<br>Just mho. Would be interested to hear if someone thinks anything about this. Cheers!"

@leonardorumalean9624,"Not trying to poke holes, but<br>if to be healthy a long term relationship seems like a good idea,<br>why doesn&#39;t Jesus (the person who is supposed to exemplify the spirit of the hero) enter a long term relationship?

After losing my mother when I was 16 I struggled for years and started law school and was failing at it. I realized that my passion was in psychology and that‚Äôs what I wanted to pursue when I was reading 12 Rules for Life. I wanted to leave law school before starting psychology, but now I feel like I can finish it and I‚Äôm using my new earned freedom to willfully put myself in this situation which gives me the power the do it. Thank you JP, you are helping many people adjust for the better."
@carlosalcalamarcos,"Quick one:<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEP5ubPMGDU&amp;t=9070"">2:31:10</a><br><br>When Peterson mentions Uncarved Block, it‚Äôs a term present in both Taoism and Confucianism.<br><br>In the sense he‚Äôs using it is actually a Confucianism approach, not a Taoist one.<br><br>Love you both guys.<br><br>Top notch conversation."
@ThePostmillennial,‚ÄúYou are morally obligated to do remarkable things‚Äù Wow. The complete opposite of modern day secular Machiavellianism. A challenging but viable notion. Well done good Sir.
@shmosel_,Podcasts are just porn for your brain.
@morsmagne,I prefer it when Jordan Peterson is being interviewed like this rather than him doing the interviewing. It&#39;s because he&#39;s a hard act to follow.
@cdcr,"Probably my favourite JP interview in a LOOOOOOOOONGGG time. Bravo on the questioning, Chris."
@calacestar,I don&#39;t understand why Jordan can&#39;t stick to his field of expertise
@tym5583,He&#39;s fallen WAYYY far from what he&#39;s been and is very detached from real problems of men today especially the challenge of the modern woman in the west and how they see MOST men<br>Peterson doesn&#39;t get that and never will
@MichalLSK,This is a best podcast I listened this year...definitely need to listen it more times to grasp that wisdom... its so hard and important
@Dionicys,Nah man. His constant rumbling made me lose interest 8 minutes into the episode.

@eleonorelettres,"Chris, I wonder if you might be a smidge neurodivergent...? A lot of the things you share lead me to think in that direction. My husband is on the autism spectrum and I recognize things there.<br>I mean no offenseüôèüèª I&#39;m a therapist (not &#39;Protestant&#39;, lol but certainly humanist and liberal) and my mind is always scanning for signs..."
@phuongdo2663,high quality video production too
@eleonorelettres,I don&#39;t believe in highjacking &#39;good&#39; to mean god... especially equating that &#39;god&#39; with the god of the biblical corpus. There&#39;s a consequence meaning creep there....

@ALSeth-Storyteller,Luciferian..
@Zen56103,"Jordan Peterson&#39;s ideas are always a mixed bag. There&#39;s some stuff that is correct and useful. But he often seems to jump on pet beliefs and double-down on them. I dislike the way that he takes stories and reads a bunch of extra meaning into them that didn&#39;t seem to be there. It&#39;s a very subjective interpretation that he&#39;s doing, but he acts like it&#39;s objective fact. He also likes to redefine words to have meanings that allow him to reach some conclusion he wants to arrive at. In some cases, like when talking about God or marriage or other important things he believes in, he seems to do this thing where he progressively builds up to some withering hyperbolic attack - describing things as &quot;the road to hell&quot; or &quot;supreme arrogance&quot; or &quot;luciferian intellect&quot;. It always feels to me like he knows that the evidence for what he&#39;s saying is questionable, so he doubles-down to pre-emptively attack anyone who&#39;s going to question his viewpoint. When he uses hyperbolic language to describe the alternative view, that&#39;s exactly the cases where his views are the least supported. I wonder if part of what he&#39;s doing is stopping his own mind from considering the opposing viewpoint. I wonder how often he takes his own advice to consider other viewpoints. For example, he seems to have a lot of beliefs about climate change that seem to be weakly supported. I can&#39;t help but think he&#39;s being anti-intellectual by confidently proclaiming his viewpoint is right on subjects that he knows very little."

@adNauseam6798,JP has been a blessing to my life. He‚Äôs helped me think outside of my typical thought processes and helped me past my nihilism. <br><br>I‚Äôll be grateful forever.
@fishinforfun3359,"Absolutely a great podcast. A must listen. I‚Äôve been raised a Christian, but I‚Äôve had my doubts at times. JP‚Äôs explanations have certainly pushed me deeper into my faith. He is a positive light for this world. And Chris, great job in showing us that."

@merriemerrie7378,"I admire Douglas Murray for his courage and compassion, as well as his intellectual honesty.  There was a time when few public intellectuals dared challenge the witch trials of woke hegemony, for fear the mob might come after them.  Murray stood out for his willingness to call out the unkindness, incivility, injustice and cruelty of leftist mobs (both inside and outside of our institutions) when they set out to destroy the reputation of others.  Murray is formidable because he is brilliant AND willing to take fire in heroic defense of others."
@annagokieli1497,This is the most thought provoking podcast I‚Äôve heard in a looooong time and I listen to Jordan daily ü§ì
@grgdggfd,honestly i struggle to understand why people will just completely reject the wisdom peterson shares because of some irrelevant political stances. hes so well spoken and appears to have a lot of things figured out

Very Dxrwinian concept, considering how militantly anti-Dxrwinism so many church authorities have been in the past. All those Galileo-hxters haven&#39;t aged well either. All of the parables about farming, plants, cooking, reproduction, etc. are also all good allusions to basic Darwinian concepts, but no one ever cares to bridge the divide aside from Peterson, Shapiro, and a few others, but they&#39;re really just taking tiny nibbles at a gigantic mountain if no one else is joining in with them."

@Islas_Canarias,"I homeschool our 15 year old son and I use Hillsdale online to teach him English literature. The very first novel they started with was Beauty and the Beast. What an adventure that was. We managed to cover English literature, history, ethics AND science all at once. The inspiration for the story came from a man who was from the Canary Islands, where I am from. He suffered from a medical condition that caused him to grow excess hair all over his body. So, once we read the story, we researched the the man then his medical condition. My son got to learn about the history of where he is from at the same time. Priceless. Next year we will be doing their World War 2 module."

@Astillion,"Jordan mentioned Dawkins several times. I think that&#39;s a que to get him on the show soon. Maybe after Jordans book has come out so Dawkins can respond to it. I&#39;m a big fan of Richard, and I&#39;ve rarely, if ever, read a book that is so good at explaining a complicated topic like The Selfish Gene.<br><br>JP is a fascinating character to me in a lot of ways. He hasn&#39;t had a big impact on me as I&#39;ve understood he has for many others. I cleaned my room, so to speak, some years before I knew of his existance. I think a lot of what he says makes sense, and certainly agree with him in the pursuit of truth. But some of the things he says also makes no sense at all to me. Specifically about God. I&#39;m a lifelong atheist, and I look forward to reading his book. I&#39;ll try my best to do it with an open mind. I wish Chris would have asked him what he means by the atheist argument. I guess he&#39;ll explain that in the book. I hope it&#39;s not going to be a strawman. If anyone reads this and knows, please enlighten me."

@Kaycee-mr5bb,I love Dr. Peterson when he went to Northern California I was excited! I missed the VIP tickets and sold out right away. But still got a seat close enough to see him and hear what he says in person. <br>I can‚Äôt wait for his next book to come out. I see him as a father figure since I lost my dad since I was 13 years old. I thank God for his wisdom and his passion to speak the truth to people ‚ù§üòä‚Ä¶

@Fisherpriest,"Stumbling towards the truth for those who have that ambition is hard enough, JBP doing it in public is a miracle. I mean that literally."
@cashway0420,"&quot;There&#39;s this pervasive belief that everything is terrible and it can&#39;t get better and the people who think it can improve are dumb and delusional and the problem... and I don&#39;t like that and I don&#39;t know where it comes from.&quot; That statement is ridiculous, the only real view you have of this world are the things you&#39;ve witnessed and felt from your own perspective. The reason he can&#39;t comprehend why some people have that belief and view of the world is because they&#39;ve been through actual hell, things so bad that normal or privileged people like the podcaster literally can&#39;t imagine. Imagine coming back from war or being raped repeatedly as a kid and still being able to have optimism and faith in this world? The answer is you actual can&#39;t imagine it unless you&#39;ve been through it no matter how much you think you can, if you haven&#39;t experienced that type of pain personally it&#39;s IMPOSSSIBLE for you to understand. That&#39;s the problem with people, we think we can put ourselves in other peoples shoes when you really can&#39;t. Drugs are a good example of that how many people dabbled with hard drugs thinking &quot;how bad can it really be to be fully addicted&quot; until they find out the hard way what hell addiction can bring, they thought they knew but had no idea. PTSD is also a very real thing, when you experienced enough darkness your brain won&#39;t function the same after, even just basic things like executive function and simple decision making will be affected, sometimes you can only take so much."

He thinks so little of people. I might be wrong he might not be athiestic but at the very least he does not believe in BS and would need 40 hours apparetly to explain that point to such an confusing result that no one would be the wiser to his position of his belief. Im also assuming that he thinks that humanity needs the manipulation and &quot;guidence&quot; since that is what he is promoting so seems most likely to be true. All the all while he knows that the masses would not be able to see through his fake representation of himself. admittingly its annyoing to me that he knows he will get away with this. since the masses are ... well.... probably you reading this."

Okay...<br><br>1) How can they possibly Hari Seldon that? <br>2) And the problem is? <br><br>Oh, a few million less humans, barely a drop in the percentage. How horrible! A tragedy, truly. Something MUST be done. RIGHT NOW! To offset that. Why is this such a worry for people? From 370 million to 366, like that&#39;s significant, on the whole.<br><br>The only area where Jordan loses me is all the god-talk and defense of religion/god and the need for it - for morality, cohesion, coping...etc. <br><br>Why is god the sum of all good? Objectively? It can only be subjective, as the very idea of god varies from person to person, even when they share the same religious faith. Christianity has over 38000 different denominations, but even if it was only a 100, it still couldn&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t be taken seriously. <br><br>Also, his whole project discussing the bible, it&#39;s great that they have these particularly deep analyses and interpretations of it and can draw more wisdom from it, but that&#39;s not how most believers are able to look at it. And that&#39;s not how they looked at it all throughout history. Not even scholars. Some believe in the talking snake, literally, while others get mad if you tell them the Earth is more than 6,000 years old. Some look at the Pope as the leader of their faith, others say &quot;Nope! Not mine!&quot; <br><br>They&#39;re giving far too much credit to scripture that was compiled from a several-decades-long game of &quot;telephone&quot;, from the life-experiences and naturally extremely limited worldview of largely illiterate, highly superstitious people, who thought lightning was a sign of an angry god, who were more concerned about not eating shrimp than putting something in the 10 big commandments about not owning slaves, maybe. Social cohesion and some moral tales aside, it cannot be taken seriously when anyone tries to defend its past or present relevance. <br><br>And atheists understand perfectly well what sacrifice means, even in the biblical narrative, partly because many were brought up religious, but also because it&#39;s not hard to understand. It&#39;s nothing special, nor is there anything more to it in a biblical context, from the way he described it. So, even those who weren&#39;t brought up in the tradition can easily understand as much, as they go through life and learn. It&#39;s just that they learn not to take scripture too seriously, or at all, certainly not as the basis for morality and guidance. Jordan severely underestimates and misunderstands how atheists &#39;function.&#39;<br><br>Of course the universities grew out of the monasteries. Where else could any sort knowledge be kept and passed throughout the Dark Ages. The church practically hoarded knowledge, while the masses remained largely ill-educated. In ancient Egypt, the priesthood was educated enough that they could predict the tides from the cycles of the moon, already, but to the common peasant their knowledge seemed divine and so they were elevated and revered, kept in power. All that isn&#39;t to say science and dogma were never at odds. Of course they were. By their very nature. And even when people had all the knowledge education could give and were revolutionary thinkers of their age, sought to answer the really tough questions, pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the nature of reality, physics, our place in the grander scheme of things/in the universe, those questions often stopped at &quot;God did it.&quot; Even Isaac Newton stopped at that, when he couldn&#39;t figure out the answer to a seemingly impossible-to-solve problem without resorting to god, and invoked the concept of a prime-mover. The people who COULD figure those questions out, later, did it without needing the god-hypothesis. The danger of seeking answers to anything, including morality, in religion/religious faith/god/the almighty - and however one would define all those - is that it is easy to just circle back and arrive at the easiest answer that is &quot;god&quot;, and be satisfied with it, especially when one already started from that position, and then believe they have given it enough rigorous thought to reassure themselves that their thinking must be sound. The people who compiled the bible probably didn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t give it even a fraction of the thought that Jordan seems to give it in his analyses and modern interpretation of it."

@kennyfernandez2866,"I think there is a deep crack in Peterson logic that even he does not notice. You can&#39;t follow conscience and society at the same time, because society alwas falls short of the ideal. Everyone makes a a choice about this every momento. Do what is right or what is expected. So the whole discourse about social hierarchies, and socially nested indentities at a certain point fall apart. Identities exist in a bounded reality, but that bounded reality is reality itself. It is truth. Truth is not fully embodied by the social reality, and such a fact is what generates all the conflicts we see today. So to posit that social rules are guides to enlightenement or understanding is bollocks. Only reason and conscience lead to truth and ARE the embodyment of truth. That&#39;s why modern people object to society defining them. Yet, to Peterson&#39;s point, deviating to hedonic pleasure is an inward option to pretend to have some standing. But deep down everyone knows their place in life. If you can be fooled by others is just cuz you are fooling yourself."

@alteredendeavor,"I used to love Peterson until he jumped way too far into the Gospel and religious areas.  I&#39;m not saying some of this isn&#39;t relevant but other books, religions, and philosophers have had equally profound sayings.  It&#39;s not unique to the specific area of focus and a lot of this screams confirmation bias.  The world is large, complicated, and nuanced.<br><br>Edit: The amount of mental gymnastics and definitional wordplay to shoehorn certain perspectives is pretty annoying.  No, God does not equal good, especially if you use the Job story you sighted.  That very situation completely nukes the idea of an all-loving, all-knowing, and all-powerful God.

@newdawnrising8110,JP could change the world this week IF ONLY he was able to take his own advise and tell the truth.

@thegoodlightllc4093,"Listening to JP talk about religion, for example, the way he just talked about the blasphemy of the Holy &quot;Ghost,&quot; is the most arrogant and prime example of how Jordan has become the very thing he claims to be so against. After he destroys even remotely the context or even close attempt at what the passage is in short about, he immediately goes onto to say how deeply he is afraid of the consequences of saying something that is false. While having no clue that he should seriously just probably tone down the religion pedastal he loves to get on and so often sounds like a typical arrogant man obsessed with and tormented by false/misguided interpretations of biblical texts."

I was a JP fan back in the day when he was speaking about responsibility and compelled speech. I&#39;m as disappointed with him as with Sam Harris and recently Douglas Murray.

@adaku75,"Dr. Petterson is brilliant and honest. He is definitely an outlier in this day and age. One of the ideas that I believe he has a blind spot about is the impact of trauma on the brain.  If you are emotionally, psychological, and or mentally abused as a child and don&#39;t focus on healing it, you can make your bed every single day and still have a level of toxic shame that will be an impediment in your life. The self-esteem issue has to be addressed not from a narcissistic perspective, but from a perspective of feeling like you are worthy of life.  It is historically accurate that most tyrants were abused as a child.  And I am sure most of the people who walk into schools and do the unthinkable were abused as well."

@Victor_Andrei,Tl;dr: &quot;I&#39;m a devout Christian&quot;
@LB-W,Jordan you have chosen a faith. On of many in this world. Now you are wrapping your intellect and extensive knowledge of phycology within it. Now the logic and evidenced behaviours of man are being reinforced by a bias you have chosen to create a positive message. You are so sure by your bias that you preach it. It does not make it right or fact. I know you know this. People will never agree upon a single delusion. Religion is just a sophisticated delusion in which an individual can act out their light and shadow internally and externally with a group. Creating a delusion within a delusion. I respect you deeply. I see your journey and struggle. You are courageous and honest about yourself. This is your most valuable gift.
@Stringz,"He understands human nature very well, its pleasant to hear someone else that really gets the mind and this life. <br>I don&#39;t see it so often.<br>I think it exists more often in people that have truly been to the darkness and back.

There are way way way too make fake and underdeveloped/inexperienced people pretending to be something else, especially on youtube. And then it&#39;s like many of them don&#39;t seem to have much self-awareness, and the audience does not seem to have awareness of it either. <br><br>hahaha, i can relate to the words a minute thing. <br>I can never type anywhere near as fast as my thoughts, so I never can capture much of anything, regardless of being able to type very fast. <br>It&#39;s like I get flooded with information, but my brain has a hard time keeping up.

@Usama_Zeki,did you ask him about &quot;Give em Hell&quot; ?
@Danivriv,"Brilliant, good one Chris, you are one of the best podcasters out there, someone who can actually let the guest speak, with great follow-up questions, and comments. One of the best podcasts with Jordan Peterson I&#39;ve heard so far.<br><br>And Jordan... I have learned and applied so much of what he communicates, it has kept me grounded during difficult times and I can say I know myself more now thanks to him. ‚ô•"

@_Jack_Miller,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEP5ubPMGDU&amp;t=11671"">3:14:31</a> with the death of God many other things die things you don&#39;t expect and one of the things that dies when God dies, is science and no one expected that. How so because science as a practice is a religious practice it&#39;s predicated on religious axioms. Is it?  Well you have to believe that there&#39;s such a thing as truth, you have to believe that the truth is understandable, you have to believe that understanding the truth is good. <br><br>Axiom: a statement or proposition which is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true"
@fernan3987,"Gracias, colega! It&#39;s been a long way and you have done a great job with your podcast. I have been both learning and enjoying from your videos since you interviewed Jordan for the first time and your objectivity and curiosity take us to a journey. I am even surprised that you throw a question I had been thinking about. Thanks to your interviews and persistent work, I went from a bad shape during covid, to own 3 companies (maybe 2 soon, but I&#39;ll keep trying, jajaja). Keep it on and, if you ever come near Marbella (Spain), allow me to show you around and introduce you some of the most cosmopolitan and successful people that live here. Take care... Please..."
@The_Man8719,loved the convo. couldn&#39;t help but notice that the ...erm...&quot;sunlight&quot; behind Jordan stay more consistent than me on a good day! üòÇ

@Shambuls,"Anything that you &quot;figure out&quot; is not the truth, because it comes from yourself and your own mind. There is no truth in human thought alone, truth is revealed and discovered, therefore ultimately understood, not &quot;figured out&quot;. For if it is figured out then that is where pride is king, for how can you &quot;figure out&quot; anything without simultaneously being prideful about it??"

@0num4,"This is Dr. Peterson in absolutely top form. He&#39;s had his missteps over the years, but I&#39;m thrilled to see him incredibly cogent, making salient arguments, breaking down immensely complex topics into their constituent parts, and forming something stronger and more resilient from all of it in the long run.<br><br>Are there aspects about which we can be critical of Dr. Peterson? Yes. However, his low-hanging-fruit critics are not listening to 3+ hour podcasts of his, deep-diving on these complex topics--they resort to the barest simplicity of &quot;Peterson is a stupid person&#39;s smart man&quot; and other vacuous insults. They haven&#39;t earned the place to judge him in such a slanderous, sophomoric way, quite frankly."

@miraomadden6195,"Im pretty sure my family and friends believe I am possessed by a symbiote lately while I try to take care of myself and ejecte my brain slug during My Great Awakening. <br><br>I was spiraling. Oh man was I spiraling, struggling with my addiction yet AGAIN. One day JP came across my FYP about gosh let&#39;s say 6 months ago because honestly my sense of time is horrid. This video was on those youtube shorts thingies and I think it was originally from this channel. This wasn&#39;t the first time I had heard of him, I had people in my life that kept trying to get me to watch him but I found him overwhelming. Maybe my mind just wasn&#39;t in the place to accept it? <br><br>I was becoming incressingly cynical with each day that passed and I was at the point where I thought it wouldn&#39;t really matter if I just stepped in front of traffic. <br><br>I did something that I am sure far too many people do when they first hear JP. Roll thier eyes and say something like &quot;Yeah sure dude. Clean my room, what is this nonsense.&quot; <br><br>I finished the short and didnt look any further into it. Now fast forward a few weeks my health started to decline faster, I wasnt able to eat anything really. I would go days without much except maybe a hobnob with my brew or a cup of broth. Some days I can&#39;t even remember if I even ate or drank anything. That was all I could hold down, I lost nearly 20kg in about 3 months, I was in so much pain as my body broke itself down. I was destroying myself, I started to get scared. Im not sure if it was my brain trying to save me from its own destruction but the JP video started playing over and over in my head so I started looking for more content. <br><br><br>Its been a few months now and I have stopped drinking, smoking, got myself off anti depression medication <b>I tried his turn your phone off thing before you start taking antidepressants thing. Yeah yeah I know I was already on them. I&#39;ve actually shut down my Facebook because I realized it was a huge part of the problem.</b> <br><br>I still struggle with my addiction and I have slipped a few times during this time, having said that I am trying my very best and will continue to try my best. <br><br>Thank you both for doing these interviews, you ask vgreat questions, that make me really think and JP always has great answers üíï <br><br>PS: For the ignorant bunch who think JP only appeals to young men. I am a BIOLOGICAL 30 something WOMAN, yes we exisit."

@DrVickyHarris,"This anti science take with all the stories about gods making a bet with devils and telling the devil to torment Job for a bet !, is like listening to kids compare fairy tales or cartoon characters.

@KG-gv7qy,Jordan is preaching the Gospel in a way I&#39;ve never heard before but no doubt it is the Holy Ghost speaking through him. The man is a prophet turning people back to the Truth the Way the Life

@breeze_himalayan,Title says something n talk is altogether different
@markfenlon7049,"I am cynical of Jordan Peterson. He strikes me to be overly judgmental and too assertive in many of his discussions and discourse.  It&#39;s disappointing because he&#39;s capable of talking about life in some useful ways but aligning it with &quot;god&quot; as though somehow thats a way forward......no. There&#39;s plenty of people who can move forward from failure without religion. Organised religion has a poor track record on human rights, social good and genuine non-self serving compassion."

@topsuperseven7910,"around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEP5ubPMGDU&amp;t=1380"">23:00</a> comes the discussion around &#39;comparison to others&#39; and some good stuff is found. I would share something from my old boxing coach, something my idiotic young self realized was true (but requires some wisdom and nuance):  <br>- He would see us trying to be like the best boxers they were fans of. the best in the club but his take was actually:   You ought to try and become the best boxers in the world. You actually do want to do that. Keeping in mind, shoot for the stars and you may get to the moon. The actual point is, why not make the &#39;ideal&#39; what is actually the best of the best.  You ought to say &quot;IF I can, I want to be Canelo/Usyk/Chavez which is to say, you start training and want to have the perfect jab, the superb footwork, that is your goal.<br>wisdom is:  You aren&#39;t &#39;comparing&#39; in some sense you now start wondering why Canelo has so much and you so little. No, you are not supposed to say &quot;ahh. phhh I&#39;m not even 10% of what Chavez was by my age!&#39;. No. <br>You don&#39;t covet them. You can see why that was a 10 commandments ban. You don&#39;t &#39;compare&#39; as in covet what they got then get angry at yourself but you can say we ought to choose the ideal, the best, the greatest master and that is what you can helpfully use as a kind of goal.<br>*some nuance wisdom is required. One member, actually doing very well, he said &quot;Ok, yes, I see Roy Jones Jr and i make that my goal, that&#39;s what I would ideal want to get to&quot; and the coach looks a little jostled and explains &quot;Okay well.. maybe not, Jones is some kind of &#39;freak human body&#39; so... ya don&#39;t try and do that&quot;.<br>but you get the idea. There is a good healthy way you say &#39;let me see the best and that&#39;s my north start to develop myself&#39; vs &#39;fcking north star is so great while I&#39;m nowhere as good&quot;."

There is another question. What did the environment do that led to your collapse? Because you&#39;re not the only one on this planet, so you can only take so much responsibility. Right? Right. Therefore, you need balance when you start looking into those things, because otherwise you&#39;re going to end up overburdening yourself with things you were not responsible for. You should only take responsibility for what you could and did do whether good or not, but make sure to realize that others are just as responsible too, to do this questioning of their own.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEP5ubPMGDU&amp;t=1454"">24:14</a> Lol.

@catejames6453,"The ‚Äúunforgivable sin‚Äù: I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs got it right. But it‚Äôs almost unspeakable.

@cameronbutton2573,"You know, I‚Äôm a reasonably intelligent person. Not outstandingly, but I have good comprehension of things and did pretty well at school.

Perhaps a JP for dummies series would be a good thing."
@thickcheeks9603,I suspect most people who talk shit about Jordan Peterson never took the time to actually listen to him. I&#39;m two hours deep in this pod and everything he said so far is inspiring and constructive.

@ianyoung8392,"To wind down after your show, if you can book a hotel with a sauna and cold plunge/swimming pool that would work wonders.  If your adrenaline is spiked to wind down 3g of vitamin C with bioflavnoids helps reset the adrenal glands and switch the liver on to detox your blood and the half life of the adrenaline.  You can also use adaptogenic herbs that are legal in all countries like Holy Basil is a particularly good one. Ashwaganda is another.  However you can only use these for two weeks before taking a break from one. Other things that help create calm are magnesium that chelated with things so a favourite floating around is a magnesium L-Threonate.  Other things to would be the hottest bath you can tolerate with as much magnesium sulphite as you can afford (epsom salts).  Taurine is also a B vitamin to help with relaxation, infact supplementing B vitamin complexes would be very wise if adrenaline is in your career a lot.  Also sympathetic nervous system really enjoys hot, cold and stretching like a gymnast to calm down.<br><br>If you imagine the most amount of adrenaline which is a fight, afterwards you get a huge adrenline dump by your liver.  When your adrenal glands have gone crazy but not enough to dump, you need to switch on a circuit to get your body to process properly.  Your body is expecting something to happen so you have to trick it.<br><br>Now Joe Rogan said he&#39;s just never had an issue with sleep, let&#39;s be clear.  Joe has got more tricks up his sleeve for healthy living and supplementary practices than you can shake a stick at.  If you use your imagination you can imagine at least several things he would do before bed if need be.  He has a bit of a bohemian/hunter gatherer lifestyle.  Think of a herb and go from there..."

People like Bill Maher who have chosen not to have children and to enjoy dating or just having sex with younger women are not psychopaths . Especially because ppl like that tell the truth about what they want and don‚Äôt want . It‚Äôs not manipulative when both the man and the woman are getting something out of it and everyone is being honest about the situation . It‚Äôs just a different path, a different lifestyle.

I was isolated, lonely, aimless, without responsibilities other than motherhood, trying to be fine but with high standards so if I was not an example how could I talk about my standards and how far I see but can‚Äôt be attained!?

Thanks Jordan and Jonathan, you‚Äôre efforts really change the world."
@christopherclayton417,"I feel that I am hearing you being very successful with taking broken men and women and helping to encourage and instill value into them. And I would say having come from a place of brokeness and desperation. I feel that is a great place to meet God. You are already willing to accept that the path you are taking is destroying you and making you extremely unhappy. In spite of what ever good feelings the hedonistic pleasire was offering it had lost all flavor. And you are seeking more. Seeking purpose. Seeking love and acceptance. Not of your continued sinful nature but of your acknowlegment that you are maybe deep in sin and that this process is going to take some mercy, patience, grace, understanding, and steadfastness. Bearing one another&#39;s burdens. As you begin to put it together. So my question is. Do you not see a place that a person who isn&#39;t sold on the hedonistic lifestyle. But maybe doesn&#39;t even know they are searching for God. They are really on the cusp of rebellion. They haven&#39;t been through all of the evils that are waiting in store on the otherside of this rebellion. Yet they are not sold on what most people around them would call lame, or square. They have no motivation to share and confess anything they have done. Especially to someone with seemingly no character defects. Would you say that this person needs to go through the sin they are flirting with, out of curiosity and social pressures? Or do you believe that a person who is much more relatable could actually sit them down and from personal experience have a chance to find out how deep they are in sin now. Because they are moved with understanding and compassion. Could they be a better guide in certain instances? Where they wouldn&#39;t feel condemned for having gone astray. Everyone serves to the capacity that they are able to or at least should strive too. A word in season from the right person is a great blessing. Different members of the Body have different functions. This is the question do you believe that everyone will respond to lets say your great moral standing. In a way that they wouldn&#39;t just hide their sins from you for fear of your judgement. After all you have walked this path upright for years. It is flat out intimidating. And greatly encoraging if you believe you can ever reach that level. and sinners that like to lie and hide things are not about to want to disappoint you. So I would say from personal experience that brokenness is successful. When desperation causes someone to seek out God. Is that the only time that you believe someone can come to God? I am trying to decide if my testimony is pandering and watered down. Or honest and vulnerable calling out to the heart. Saying I know what it is like to have enjoyed instant gratification out of ignorance. Then out of stubbornness, then out of willingness. And still though it may be a long process. The Lord Jesus is faithful. And He will continue the good work He has begun in you until the end. I didn&#39;t have a dad in my life a few unstable step dads. My mom didn&#39;t need to kick me out of the nest I was running the streets and not listening from 13-14 years old. Mom had to work my sister didn&#39;t have authority in my eyes. And I likely needed a strong dependable authority figure. But that was not at all what I was looking for if you asked me. The last 3 guys that had come and gone were obviously flawed in my mind. I want to reach people where they are before they end up a statistic.  I just feel that I value what you do. And I am not you. Yet I am tasked with the same task. Does nobody but you have something to offer? Does God not allow you to reach the hearts and minds of individuals? Or is all the increase and glory yours? You sharpen me. You may call out the best in me. I am not convinced though that the exclusive road to salvation flows through you alone."

@remi4020,I highly value Jordan and his insights into the human psyche. However his not so recent plunge into the religious is truly disgusting to behold.<br>The arrogance with which he performs his mental and metaphysical gymnastics to somehow push everything into the christian religious lens is really sad to see.<br>And nobody seems to really call him out on it. Such a disappointment...

@warrenny,One of the better Peterson conversations I&#39;ve heard. Nice video.
@KotaTheBear,he&#39;s becoming the Joker right before our very eyes.
@MichaelJPartyka,I feel like Dr. Peterson still doesn&#39;t have the difference between Cain and Abel&#39;s sacrifices down yet. It&#39;s more a matter of offering the wrong class of sacrificial material -- Cain&#39;s plant life vs. Abel&#39;s animal life -- than offering less than one&#39;s best. I know Dr. Peterson was clued into this during the Exodus seminar (IIRC) but he hasn&#39;t absorbed it as correct yet.

@shawnboadway7736,"I thoroughly enjoyed this conversation. My only issue is from the second half where Peterson once again insists that ‚Äúthe atheists‚Äù reject the biblical narrative because they just don‚Äôt get it. He then proceeds to use the biblical narrative in such creative ways that it‚Äôs no wonder they don‚Äôt get it. He‚Äôs pulling things out of the narrative that aren‚Äôt there. Take Cain and Abel. He continues to draw lessons out of this story which depend on his understanding of why god accepted Abel‚Äôs sacrifice and rejected Cain‚Äôs. But here‚Äôs the rub: the biblical narrative doesn‚Äôt tell us why god rejected Cain‚Äôs sacrifice and accepted Abel‚Äôs. It really not fair to accuse others of missing what‚Äôs not actually there until you (Peterson) put it there. I get it, like any good preacher Peterson fills the stories in to make points that his audience can use in their lives. But don‚Äôt confuse that for understanding what the biblical author was actually saying and then scold ‚Äúthe atheists‚Äù for not getting this! Also, his insistence in using God language in more modern ways is fine for him if that‚Äôs the language he feels most at home with. But his god concept can just as easily be called by different names (the summation of all that is good) if the god language doesn‚Äôt work for you. If God has simply become an abstract concept now mostly divorced from the concept as understood by humans for 1000s of years, then why so much angst over going one more step and no longer bothering with the word itself?"

@espositoentertainment6010,"Jordan great to see you, I have placed you at my imaginary table. Thank you for the wisdom."
@unnamed5603,aaah JP...the andrew tate of the so-called intellectuals
@hgfw9295,I thank Jordan for enhancing my English. It isn&#39;t my mother tongue and I listen all the podcasts of all creators in English and barely find the difficulty to understand the message until I step on Jordan speaking. I love it how I&#39;m not only learning about the principles of decent living but also the new words I only knew in Polish before.tank you for never going the easy pathway with us listeners Jordan.
@midwesttex,Dr. Peterson asked me to ask myself hard questions. I did. And the answers were brutal.
@controllerbrain,"It&#39;s too late. My life has already been destroyed, all my own fault for not being smarter. I was just being me."
@kwg5044,"It&#39;s such an amazing time to be alive. Thanks to what you both are a part of, we have surge of rennaisance men. For what it&#39;s worth, Thank you. I fuggin&#39; love you"
@1pagelifeplan,Learning from your enemies is genius! Just opening up without letting the negative energy bring you down
@pursuitofspirit,Amazing episode. Great questions Chris. JP is truly one of the greatest minds of our time.
@albertlevins9191,Your first podcast with this man was the reason I subscribed.<br>Excited about this one.<br>LES GO!

@michaeltoppo9794,hour in. as someone who gas listened to almost every public word of JBP - this is the most captivating interview i‚Äôve seen in years. thank you!!!
@ExtremelyTastyBread,can someone post the crying timestamps
@audreybee2410,"I love you Chris, I love you Jordan!"
@jroddog1,"JP crying on Piers show after being told that incels follow him and then talking sh*t about Andrew Tate‚Äôs followers seems something of a contradiction. Tate called out True Geordie to a fight after Geordie talked crap about the webcam girls working for Tate, then come to find out TG liked the idea of rubber cylinders up the rear via girls maybe if more dirt beyond the pills comes out on Jordan, Tate and company won‚Äôt be so easy on him either."

@ThreeWishes777,"I see a lot jealously from people that wasted their life and blame society for not taking the opportunities for not sacrificing themselves for their future.  They can&#39;t accept the reality of their character and how they didn&#39;t focus they didn&#39;t let behaviors or people holding them back. Now they see the success of others hate them. Society is becoming bitterness towards success is incredible. <br>Hate the game aka nature, not the player."

@k1xnt,god please let this be 2016 college professor JP and not 2023 conservative shrill jp
@rwesenberg,Thanks you. An interesting conversation. Cynesism is also a way of manipulating masses of people by reinforcing their resentment thus neutralising them. It also may be a results of the rampant sopipsism of our time bel;ieving the world is all inside my head.  Idealism?

@l.3626,"Im a huge listener to Jordan since years, but I disagree with many points. <br><br>Im also a fan of telling the truth like him, but I think his body language reflects it, that he doesnt even agree with what he said himself. <br><br><br>Birthrate decline has a simple reason, the young people constantly need to pay for the old, especially men, bc men pay more taxes and men receive not enough money on education and then we have feminism. Young men and woman are basically being sold out systemetically. Pickup artists are also not the reason for incels. The problem is those men dont earn enough money. The stupist person is not the person who doesnt ask, bc if you can read the room you dont need to ask, men are able to read the room, thats why they are not approaching anymore, men are not dumb. <br><br>I hate how Jordan always goes on the person level and completly ignores the environment for young men. Imagine you are living in a Conzentration camp, of course you are miserable and your mental health is not good. He sees it very good that a relationship can improve mental health, but in the age of feminism its extremly tough to find a good one, while young people are more buisy than ever just trying to survive money wise. Like ofc you need to be a good men, its not that complicated, its very simple, but hard. Ofc there are many fatherless men, so its probably good to have guidance, but once you are a good man you will still face systemically problems that are against you you can do nothing about, bc they are not your personal responsiblity, like being a good woman (feminism). <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>JP is also talking about Sex. He is saying &quot;lets say you are reducing sexuality to the act of sex, thats what you have reduced yourself to, but its even more than that, its the kind of sexual desire that wants gratification right now with no relationship whatsoever, ... why not just use porn, its a lot simpler, the answer is that is what men are doing, reduced themselves to a short term desire ... so whatever sex is for human beings its embeded in a relationship ... one night stand people are psychopathic, narcicistic, machiavellian, sadistic ... Im not like that but if you practice this for 5 years, &quot;<br>&quot;woman who are taking advantage of themselves for short term sexual gratification, those arent happy woman, they are usually damaged woman&quot; - ye basically every woman nowadays&quot;<br><br>JP loves to talk about male responsibility, but never talks about the responsiblity of a good woman, which is not being a whore mainly. JP totally ignores that men are systemetically disadvantaged and always only tells them to find a solution on personal level,which is good ofc to reach potential, but sometimes in life you simply have no room for improvement. Thats why much of the self improvement stuff in past decade has been a disappointment for men, bc they actually did everything and nothing improved, atleast not enough that it justifies the effort.<br>Andrew Tate is just based in reality and calls it by the name, that modern woman are just absolute promiscious woman and men dont want to invest into those woman anymore. Also Andrew Tate never gave advice to also have short term sexual gratification with woman, he is actually the opposite, he is telling men invest into good woman. You are simpl a cuck if you invest into a woman who had sex for free with other men but now you need to pay for it, thats why a virgin woman is important. Woman want a family, men want sex, woman cant have a family without a mans investment, but why would a man pay for sex if another man got it for free. <br>Its actually not a mans problem, but a womans problem when there is no investment from the man. Man can have sex without investment, men already have enough responsiblity in the world, sex is a womans responsiblity. <br><br>He is also talking about Russel crossing lines with woman while he is on coke, but never questions the responsiblity of those woman, like why are those woman even in those places.<br>JP only cares about the responsibility of men, and ignores the responsiblity of woman.<br><br>The question is also why do men get no access to woman without also going into the party scene. The answer is bc its the only place woman are not being held accountable and it gives room for the grey zone, woman are the reason for hook up culture. Our laws are setup for cucks where you get baby traped for 18 years bc you have to pay child support."

@KaiserBP,"Even with all of his wisdom, he still raised a modern feminist daughter. Divorced the good guy archetype husband to party with Mr Tate, her fathers enemy lol. Stop taking advice from boomers who haven&#39;t been in the dating scene in decades."
@L.I.T.H.I.U.M,"Chris, post the clip where Peterson explains the definition of God. It&#39;s too good. Pun intended."
@AlijiEnes,For a person that has spoken so much about being honest and telling the truth Jordan Peterson has betrayed his own self and everything he stands for by supporting something he has been very vocal against!
@beybladeknights1223,Jordan Peterson is an emotionally weak man. The last weeks clears showed how irrational he can become
@samuelsamsonian5832,Best spot for a manscaped ad during a story about Ron Jeremy.
@marti3710,I am loving Jordan is sneak-wearing a joker outfit.
@Simply_Simian,"Dr.Peterson gave me the insight and wisdom I have needed to endure the hardest years of my life. Since discovering Dr.Peterson, I‚Äôve lost my Mom to cancer, watched my dog get hit and killed by a truck in a freak accident, and have dealt with various other personal struggles. The reason Dr.Peterson is resonating with a growing audience is because he offers the antithesis to the prevailing, purported modern mythos that struggle and triumph are to be waged against systemic structures, that all misery is to be confronted outside of ourselves  perpetrated on us at the hands of someone else. But, if you‚Äôve ever personally struggled with, say, the death of a parent, you know in your heart, mind, and soul, that that advice is terrible and will not address the problem. Instead of looking outside yourself and thinking ‚Äúwell, if the entire system was just re-organized in my favour, maybe then I could have the opportunity to rise,‚Äù you realize you must start with yourself. And that is a far greater, far more powerful and meaningful task to undertake, and it‚Äôs also within your grasp whenever you are willing to take the responsibility necessary to understand that you must start with yourself. When you do that, the strength, wisdom, and character you painstakingly develop then shines outward and benefits all of those who depend on you or may now depend on you as a force for good. From one of the many, many people Dr.Peterson has steered away from the abyss and instead into the light, thank you. And thank you to all the other brave souls who are willing to undertake the daunting task of pursuing the good despite every reason not to."

@KaizenWithRen,goated podcast <br><br>some of Dr Peterson‚Äôs answers here are getting a bit repetitive tho
@ryanbox4,"I would love the opportunity to speak with Mr. Peterson privately. I think from the music alone (random condensed, start to finish, on spotify), the conversation would be interesting, and I would love to hear his thoughts and notes on my compilations of subjective experience. (While I know I&#39;m grounded, stoic, and straightbacked, I would be curious what he would think/do in that circumstance. I dont have a god complex. It&#39;s just a new qualia of phenomenon, philosophically, I&#39;m not sure the implications, but in the &quot;pyschic&quot; phenomenon, Jung would have had a hayday with this case. Personally I stick to, get me funding and I&#39;ll make a piece of art that is worthwhile, original, and for the betterment of society. Something truly out of the box. It is wrong for extreme cynicism and lack of funding to perpetuate this problem onto me, which I was more born into than chose. Im not asking a lot, and I would argue after my experience it would be better for society at large if I was allowed to create freely without the constraints that society have already placed on me. I deep dove into the truth, and I do feel like the man blinded by the sun returning to the cave. I dont know what else I could say. Truly Mr. Peterson, I would value your insight more then you can imagine. I have a softmoric theory on the root of evil, that I believe is developed enough for your consideration. Best wishes, and thank you to the channel. It is cathartic for me to hear other philosophically minded individuals developing society publically like this...I am always struck by your gentlemens presence and character. I do have some serious questions about hierarchy, discipline, punishment, etc. It feels like I was undercut creatively, not developed by pressure, like continuing to press a diamond, society philosophically seems to be wasting my time/potential/youth, and I&#39;m seeing wider range consequences as a result of me not having the resources to even compete with the worlds demons. War/prostitution, etc...its a deep conversation."

@ericdraven3654,A few days ago I had a weird dream with Jordan Peterson. We were on a battlefield and Jordan was leading an army against Napoleon. At some point Napoleon spotted Jordan and sent his best soldier to kill him. The soldier stabbed Jordan to death but somehow Jordan managed to throw a spear to Kill Napole√≥n or something like that. I dont know what the hell this dream means but Jordan&#39;s teachings and books have helped so much. I struggle to get out of bed almost every single day but JP has helped me reframe my suffering and reshape my Life. Cheers from Spain ‚ù§
@AFringedGentian,"This makes me a little choked up.<br>The last time Dr. Peterson was on, he was still very ill and fragile. He was in a lot of pain, and it showed in his eyes.

@adronias,"oh come on, 3 and a 1/2 hour interview with Jordan Peterson?! I had other things to do. fine fine I&#39;ll listen."
@endgamefond,"What Dr. Jordan Peterson taught me is to own your shadows/darkness/flaws/mistakes/uneasy truths. Freaking own it. He is been telling us to tell truths for our own&#39;s sakes. That is how you get tough, and it can counter act the super sensitive part of ourselves that get hurt too easily. I have watched his lectures/interviews for I think 3 years now, that lesson is the most valuable lesson I will bring into my own grave. Jung and him is part of top list people I will be thankful for forever."
@jeffinrodriguez914,Can&#39;t think of anyone who made a more profound impact on how I view the world.
@SigmaWarrior1978,Dope content from 2 dope men in a classy setting.  Thanks heaps brothers.
@EsseQuamVideriSe7en,"I met Mr. Peterson at the Edmonton, Alberta, VIP Meet and Greet earlier this year. He made every single person he met feel like they were the only person in the room. I can&#39;t exactly explain it, but he has the &quot;it factor&quot;. There was just a genuineness and humility to him that would be nearly impossible to fake. <br><br>Jordan cares. That&#39;s the only way to say it. He cares."
@toms7114,"The first 3 minutes of this conversation Jordan Peterson described the behavior patterns of my father, and myself between 14 and 17 when I realized where those behaviors led. Life may not be as &quot;safe&quot; since I stopped only telling the truth in such a way that it was interpreted in my favor that I&#39;d designed, but it has led me to places that I never thought I&#39;d go to."

@bhavprajapati,"I don&#39;t care what anyone says about Dr. Peterson (and a few others), he made me face the truth of myself and how pathetic I was. Always tell the truth even if it hurts you to your bones. I overcome so much because of it but I got more to do.<br><br>Update (added Nov 9, 2024) - I posted a video update about my comment from Nov 28 2023, it&#39;s also an apology for failing to deliver what I intended. <br><br>Update (added Oct 27, 2024) - The essay turned into a narrative on Canadian Identity tied to my identity. Since I posted that comment I became a standup comic, went viral on Instagram and still currently jobless because the Canadian tech economy sucks. I am a health tech professional, out of work, trying to get by with freelancing. I am going to post a video about my journey and give an update on the book. I think the comment I posted last year became a call to adventure to face myself even more and I learned more about myself than I when I posted it last year. <br><br>Update (added on Tuesday Nov 28, 2023 at 8:40 am EST) - Thank you so much for all your positive comments. I was overwhelmed, truly. Thank you Chris for highlighting as well. This outpouring has inspired me to be more open about a project I am working on because I am scared to release it... I am a Canadian and I am creating a video essay to take down Trudeau. I don&#39;t support any political party but I also don&#39;t support tyrannical narcissists either. We&#39;re going to make Trudeau face himself like I had to, we&#39;re going to make himself look in the mirror. We&#39;re going to teach the world how to make a positive difference. There are too many narcissists in power now, enough is enough."
